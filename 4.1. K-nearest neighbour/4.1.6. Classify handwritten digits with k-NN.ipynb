    "The goal of this exercise is to build a k-NN classifier to recognize images from the MNIST dataset using a Pipeline object. According to the official web page, the accuracy of a k-NN classifier trained on the raw pixels is around 95% and above 99% for convolutional neural networks.\n",

    "The KNeighborsClassifier object from Scikit-learn implements several algorithms to find the k nearest neighbors to a given data point. The simplest strategy is to compute the distance to every other data points from the training set and select the k closest ones. This is called brute-force search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms donâ€™t need to compute the distance to every data points at runtime. However, they require to build a sort of index of the dataset before running the algorithm, and this operation can be computationally expensive for large ones. In our case, the brute strategy is faster. Hence, you might want to set the algorithm parameter to 'brute'"
