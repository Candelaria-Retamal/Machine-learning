Coronavirus: Federal Council declares ‘extraordinary situation’ and introduces more stringent measures,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78454.html,2020-03-16,"Bern, 16.03.2020 - At an extraordinary meeting today, 16 March 2020, the Federal Council took the decision to introduce more stringent measures to protect the public. It has declared that an ‘extraordinary situation’ now exists in Switzerland in terms of the Epidemics Act. All shops, restaurants, bars and entertainment and leisure facilities will remain closed until 19 April. Not affected by the new ruling are food stores and healthcare institutions. As of midnight, it is also introducing checks on the borders to Germany, Austria and France. The Federal Council has also authorised the deployment of up to 8000 members of the armed forces to assist the cantons at hospitals and with logistics and security. In view of the accelerated spread of the coronavirus, the Federal Council is introducing more stringent measures to protect the public. It has now declared that an ‘extraordinary situation' exists in Switzerland in terms of the Epidemics Act. This allows the Federal Council to order the introduction of uniform measures in all cantons. The cantons were given prior notice of the move.As of midnight tonight, all public and private events are prohibited. All shops, markets, restaurants, bars and entertainment and leisure facilities, such as museums, libraries, cinemas, concert halls and theatres, sports centres, swimming pools and ski areas are to close. Also affected are businesses at which the recommended distance cannot be maintained, such as hairdressers and cosmetics studios.Provision of the entire population with foodstuffs, medicinal products and essential everyday items is assured; there are sufficient stocks. Food stores, takeaway businesses, company canteens, food home delivery services and pharmacies will remain open, as will petrol stations, railway stations, banks, post offices, hotels, public administrations and social institutions. Maintenance facilities for means of transport may remain open. However, all of these establishments must follow the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health on hygiene and keeping your distance. Hospitals, clinics and medical practices will remain open, but must forego non-urgent medical procedures and treatments. People atespecially high risk should work from home. If that is not possible, they are to be placed on leave by their employers, but will continue to receive their pay.The new Ordinance on Measures to fight the Coronavirus also clarifies the question of child day-care facilities. The cantons are required to ensure that childcare is provided for children who cannot be looked after privately. Child day-care facilities may only be closed if other suitable arrangements exist. This measure will apply for the time being until 19 April. School closures will also now apply until this date.The Federal Council is also calling on members of the public to avoid all unnecessary contact, to keep their distance from others, and to follow the recommended hygiene measures. It is calling on the elderly in particular to remain at home.Up to 8000 members of the armed forces to assist with healthcare, logistics and securityThe Federal Council is expecting that the civilian authorities will require significant support from the armed forces in the coming days and weeks. In order to respond to requests from the cantons, the Federal Council is raising the upper limit for civilian support services from 800 to 8000 members of the armed forces. This measure will apply until the end of June.The armed forces will be able to support the healthcare system by providing medical services, particularly patient care, patient supervision, ambulance services and hospital logistics (e.g. disinfecting beds, as well as kitchen, laundry and cleaning services). Secondly, the armed forces can if necessary take on logistical tasks such as transport services, and assist in the construction of improvised infrastructures. Thirdly, in terms of security they can relieve pressure on the cantonal police services, for example by providing additional support regarding embassy protection, or by assisting the Border Guard at border crossings and at airports.Around 3000 members of the armed forces will be made available to provide medical service support. They will be deployed immediately. The exact number of armed forces personnel deployed will depend on how the situation develops and on requests from the relevant authorities.Conscript formations with high readiness to be mobilisedMilitary units that are currently on active service will be deployed first. The time spent on service for recruit schools, single-term conscripts and refresher courses will be extended wherever necessary. For certain duties, additional troops will need to be mobilised. This applies in particular to members of conscript formations with high readiness, including all four hospital battalions and five medical units. These formations can be deployed within four days of the decision to mobilise. The order to mobilise will be issued later today.In order to be able to respond quickly and effectively to further developments and the needs of civilian authorities, the Federal Council has also authorised the DDPS to mobilise other troops in addition to conscript formations with high readiness. This may mean that certain troops will be mobilised only temporarily, so that they can be trained for deployment as a precautionary measure. After a few days' training, they will be released from duty and can be called up again at a later date if requested by the cantons.Border checksThe Federal Council has decided to introduce checks at the borders with Germany, Austria and France as of midnight tonight, and impose entry bans, albeit with exceptions. On Friday, it had already imposed Schengen border controls on persons entering from Italy. Entry to Switzerland from its four large neighbours is now only possible for Swiss citizens, persons holding a residence permit for Switzerland and persons who have to enter Switzerland for work-related reasons. Transit and goods traffic will continue to be allowed as well. Lastly, people will also be able to enter Switzerland in emergency situations. These measures are intended to protect the Swiss population and maintain capacities in the Swiss health service. In order to implement these measures in a targeted manner, smaller border crossings around the country will be closed and cross-border traffic channelled through larger crossings. A list of these crossings will be published by the Federal Customs Administration.The Federal Council will continue monitor the situation closely. It has tasked the FDJP to work with the FDHA and the FDFA to consider extending border checks and entry bans to travellers from other countries severely affected by the spread of the coronavirus.

Coronavirus: Federal Council bans gatherings of more than five people,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78513.html,2020-03-20,"Bern, 20.03.2020 - The Federal Council is stepping up measures to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed with serious cases of coronavirus disease. At its meeting on 20 March, it decided to ban gatherings of more than five people. Persons who do not comply with this may be fined. Employers in the construction sector and in industry will also be required to comply with the federal recommendations on hygiene and social distancing. Companies that do not comply may be closed down. With these measures, the Federal Council is aiming to avoid the need to take even further-reaching action. In an additional move, the Federal Council is making civil defence units available to cantons requiring assistance. The Federal Council has urged the population, especially those who are ill or over 65 years of age, to stay at home. People should only go out if they have to go to work or have a doctor's appointment, or if they need to buy food or help others. This measure is intended to protect people who are at high risk from the disease and to prevent the intensive care units in hospitals from being overburdened with serious cases.Because people have not being fully complying with this measure and the rules on social distancing, the Federal Council has decided to ban gatherings of more than five people in public places, and especially in public squares, on footpaths and in parks. People in groups of fewer than five people must keep a distance of at least two metres from each other. The police may impose a fine for non-compliance.In order to prevent the closure of construction sites and to offer better protection to employees, the Federal Council is requiring employers in the construction sector and industry to comply with the federal recommendations on hygiene and social distancing. Employers must limit the number of people present on construction sites or in other workplaces, and prevent groups of more than five people from gathering in break rooms and canteens. The cantons may close down individual companies or construction sites if they do not comply.The Federal Council has made further amendments to the related COVID-19 Ordinance. These will come into force at midnight. It has imposed a more detailed ban on non-urgent medical procedures in hospitals. In addition, postal service providers are now permitted to deliver food and everyday items ordered online to the population seven days a week. Exceptional permits for Sunday work or for driving commercial vehicles on Sundays are no longer required.Federal Council makes civil defence units availableIn the last few weeks, in various cantons, persons on civil defence service have already been deployed to assist with the corona crisis, for example to set up and run reception centres at hospitals or hotlines for the population. The Federal Council expects that throughout Switzerland civilian authorities, private and public institutions and organisations, and population groups that are particularly affected will increasingly need support in the coming weeks.The Federal Council has therefore decided to make up to 850,000 days of civil defence service available to the cantons. The Federal Act on Civil Protection and Civil Defence provides that the Federal Council may assign persons on civil defence service to assist in the event of disasters and emergencies affecting several cantons or the whole of Switzerland. In line with the rules on Armed Forces civil support service, assistance will be limited until the end of June 2020. The cantons remain responsible for deciding on the deployment and specific tasks of civil defence units, for calling up those required to serve and for the conduct of civil defence assignments. The Confederation will pay the cantons a fixed rate of CHF 27.50 for each day of service rendered. The costs will amount to a maximum of CHF 23.4 million.The Federal Council's decision also permits intercantonal assignments, for example in regions that particularly need support but cannot meet this need with their own resources.Civil defence units will carry out tasks in various areas: in particular, they can support the health service and social care institutions, for example by assisting in the outpatient care of the elderly and those in need of care, distributing meals or providing transport services. Civil defence units can also carry out civil engineering work and provide support in the form of logistics and management. This includes transport or catering for emergency services, setting up and operating reception desks at hospitals, supporting crisis teams and operating hotlines. The cantons will decide on which tasks take priority according to their needs. The Federal Council has urged the population, especially those who are ill or over 65 years of age, to stay at home.

Coronavirus: Switzerland extends border controls to all Schengen States,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78563.html,2020-03-25,"Bern, 25.03.2020 - At its meeting on 25 March, the Federal Council was informed by the FDJP that entry restrictions have been extended to all Schengen States. This measure will increase the protection given to the population against the coronavirus. Last week, the Federal Council took the decision to impose restrictions on entry by land and by air from Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Spain, and from all non-Schengen States. Since midnight, these stricter entry requirements have also applied to flights from all remaining Schengen States with the exception of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The relevant authorities in the EU have been notified of the changes.With the extension of the stricter entry requirements to cover flights from all Schengen States and the checks being made on these entry requirements as part of border controls at airports, all flights from abroad are now subject to the same entry checks.  Citizens of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, persons with a Swiss residence permit and persons who have to travel to Switzerland for work-related reasons or because of an emergency will continue to be allowed to enter the country. Travellers may continue to transit through Switzerland and movements of goods are still permitted.These measures aim to protect the Swiss population even more effectively against infection with the coronavirus and to maintain capacities in the Swiss healthcare sector.Under the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons, associated states are entitled to restrict the free movement of persons for reasons of public order, security and health.

Coronavirus: Federal Council adopts emergency ordinance on granting of credits with joint and several federal guarantees,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78572.html,2020-03-25,"Bern, 25.03.2020 - During its extraordinary meeting on 25 March 2020, the Federal Council addressed the issue of liquidity assistance for SMEs, which should have rapid access to credit facilities to bridge liquidity shortfalls caused by the new coronavirus pandemic. Companies are advised to apply for the credit facilities at their main bank. Facilities will be secured by the Confederation. The corresponding ordinance enters into force on 26 March 2020, from which date credit applications can be submitted. Last Friday, 20 March 2020, the Federal Council presented a comprehensive package of measures to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Bridging credit facilities should provide companies with sufficient liquidity to cover their current overheads despite turnover reductions associated with the new coronavirus. These are in addition to the measures already approved by the Federal Council in the area of short-time working and COVID-19 loss of earnings compensation to cover wage costs. The ordinance now adopted by the Federal Council includes a bridging programme worth CHF 20 billion for liquidity shortfalls. A quick and straightforward process Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Certain minimum criteria must be met. In particular, the company must declare that it is suffering substantial reductions in turnover because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation, and will be paid out quickly and with the minimum of bureaucracy. Zero interest will be charged. The credit application form will be available on the website ""covid19.easygov.swiss"" from Thursday, after the ordinance enters into force. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. Companies with a turnover of more than CHF 500 million are not covered by this programme. As many SMEs only have a bank account with PostFinance, the Federal Council has made it possible for PostFinance to also be able to provide its business clients with unbureaucratic access to credit facilities of up to CHF 500,000. This does not exempt PostFinance from the ban on providing credit facilities, rather it is a temporary measure as part of this programme. Credits should be easily, quickly and simply accessible to all those concerned as of tomorrow, Thursday, 26 March 2020. On 23 March 2020, the Finance Delegation (FinDel) approved a guarantee credit of CHF 20 billion. Ensuring the stability of the Swiss economy remains the FDF's top priority. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) support the Federal Council's liquidity package and are rolling out additional measures of their own. With this straightforward measure, the Federal Council is supporting tens of thousands of Swiss SMEs with their most urgent liquidity needs.

Coronavirus: Federal Council approves deactivation of countercyclical capital buffer,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78604.html,2020-03-27,"Bern, 27.03.2020 - During its meeting on 27 March 2020, the Federal Council approved the proposal of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to deactivate the countercyclical capital buffer with immediate effect. This measure gives banks more flexibility in granting credits designed to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The countercyclical capital buffer strengthens banking sector resilience in the event of corrections resulting from imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets. At the same time, it helps to prevent these markets from overheating. It requires banks to hold additional capital for residential mortgage loans. In view of the exceptional situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the SNB submitted a proposal to the Federal Council requesting the immediate deactivation of the countercyclical capital buffer. The Federal Council approved this proposal at its meeting on 27 March 2020. This measure will give banks more flexibility in their lending activities, allowing them to better meet the credit and liquidity needs of households and businesses. It complements the package of measures announced by the Federal Council to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Deactivation can take place because the threatened recession is likely to reduce overheating in the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets. In addition, it is important that the banks' lending activities comply with the Swiss Bankers Association guidelines on minimum requirements in mortgage lending, as well as the recently adjusted guidelines on residential investment property. Furthermore, the Federal Council supports the recommendations on distributions and bonuses made by the SNB and FINMA.

Coronavirus: Federal Council extends measures by a week and decides on gradual easing,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78744.html,2020-04-08,"Bern, 08.04.2020 - The measures introduced to combat the coronavirus epidemic are being followed well and are having the desired effect. They will be extended by a week until Sunday, 26 April, but should then gradually begin to be eased before the end of the month. That is the decision taken by the Federal Council at its meeting on 8 April. The Federal Council will decide on steps to ease the measures at its next meeting on 16 April. The COVID-19 epidemic has spread widely in Switzerland. However, the speed at which it is spreading has slowed significantly in recent days. The measures put in place to combat the virus are being followed well by the public and are having the desired effect. In view of this epidemiological trend and based on the recommendations of scientific advisors, the Federal Council is extending the measures in place to combat the COVID-19 epidemic by a week until Sunday, 26 April. However, the first careful steps towards gradually easing the measures should commence before the end of the month.The criteria for easing the measures are the number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths. A further decisive factor is how well the rules on hygiene and social distancing are being adhered to and whether people are avoiding gathering in large numbers.

Switzerland should continue to be supplied with essential goods andthe impact on society and the economy should be minimised.In view of the epidemiological situation in the canton of Ticino, the Federal Council has authorised the cantonal authorities to extend restrictions on the economic sector until 19 April. The COVID-19 epidemic has spread widely in Switzerland. However, the speed at which it is spreading has slowed significantly in recent days. The measures put in place to combat the virus are being followed well by the public and are having the desired effect. In view of this epidemiological trend and based on the recommendations of scientific advisors, the Federal Council is extending the measures in place to combat the COVID-19 epidemic by a week until Sunday, 26 April. However, the first careful steps towards gradually easing the measures should commence before the end of the month. The criteria for easing the measures are the number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths. A further decisive factor is how well the rules on hygiene and social distancing are being adhered to and whether people are avoiding gathering in large numbers. The Federal Council will decide on steps to ease the measures at its next meeting on 16 April. Various conditions must be met if steps to ease measures are to be implemented successfully.

Coronavirus: Federal Council examines bridging loans for aviation industry,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78741.html,2020-04-08,"Bern, 08.04.2020 - At its meeting on 8 April 2020, the Federal Council instructed the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) together with the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) and the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER) to draft a proposal on providing temporary liquidity support to the Swiss aviation industry, which has been particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The focus is on federal guarantees for airlines; they are subject to strict conditions and are only to be granted if the companies are unable to meet their liquidity needs by any other means. As with other sectors, the aviation industry has been severely affected by the measures taken to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Aircraft movements at Swiss airports have dropped by more than 95%. Several players in the Swiss aviation sector are therefore facing liquidity shortfalls. The aviation industry is an economically critical infrastructure: prolonged interruption to Switzerland's international links would involve substantial economic losses. In Switzerland, more than a third of all exports and around one sixth of all imports are transported via air freight. The annual added value generated directly and indirectly by private aviation amounts to around CHF 30 billion and concerns around 190,000 jobs*.At its meeting on 8 April 2020, the Federal Council, in agreement with the cantons, therefore declared its willingness to examine measures to ensure that Switzerland's international air links are not threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. The prerequisite for any financial support is appropriate burden sharing: the state will play only a secondary role. First and foremost, the airlines and their owners are required to implement all reasonable measures.Prerequisites for federal aidThe Federal Council instructed the FDF, together with the DETEC and the EAER, to propose measures to ensure the liquidity of the airlines that are economically important for international air links, while taking these prerequisites into account.The focus is on federal guarantees. These are to be subject to strict prerequisites in order to minimise the risk for the Confederation. This includes proof that all financing possibilities have been exhausted. In addition, funds generated in the future are to be used primarily to repay the liquidity assistance (no dividends or intra-group repayments or transfers until the guaranteed loan has been fully repaid). An additional prerequisite is that the Confederation should be entitled to interest at market rates or other indemnities. Funds guaranteed by the Confederation should also be proportionate to the parent companies' commitment and should be used solely to secure Swiss infrastructures (no cash outflows to parent companies abroad). Finally, long-term assurances that Switzerland's international air links will be maintained will also be expected.Furthermore, the Federal Council has instructed the aforementioned departments to propose measures or any legislative amendments which would ensure that Switzerland's airports continue to operate without interruption and in an orderly manner.The departments concerned will draw up a corresponding proposal for the Federal Council by the end of April.* This sentence was edited on 9 April 2020.

Federal Council to gradually ease measures against the new coronavirus,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78818.html,2020-04-16,"Bern, 16.04.2020 - On 27 April, hospitals will be able to resume all medical procedures, including non-urgent procedures, and outpatient medical practices, hairdressing salons, massage practices and cosmetic studios will be allowed to reopen. DIY stores, garden centres and florists will also be allowed to reopen. The protection of the public and of staff must be assured. These are the steps decided by the Federal Council at its meeting on 16 April. If the situation allows, schools for children of compulsory school age and shops will be able to reopen on 11 May. On 8 June, upper-secondary schools, vocational schools and higher education institutions, as well as museums, zoos and libraries may reopen. The Federal Council also issued further details with regard to protecting workers at especially high risk. In view of the epidemiological trend and based on expert recommendations, from 27 April the Federal Council will begin to ease the measures put in place to protect the public from the new coronavirus. To help people and businesses to plan, it is also announcing its schedule for the further easing of lockdown measures up to the start of June.The Federal Council has taken into account a range of risk factors in determining the phases for easing the measures. These include the resulting increase in human contact and movements of people, the number of people at high risk affected, and the ability of businesses to take precautionary measures. It has also evaluated the economic benefits of the individual phases.Protecting public health and limiting the economic impactThe Federal Council's strategy for emerging from the lockdown has a number of aims: first and foremost, is continuing to protect the health of the Swiss population, particularly of people at especially high risk. The easing of lockdown measures will be accompanied by businesses and institutions taking precautionary measures. Depending on the sector concerned, these could include a recommendation or obligation to wear face masks. The Federal Council wishes to minimise the economic impact and relax restrictions on basic rights. The strategy should be implemented uniformly across the country, taking into account measures in neighbouring countries.First phase commencing 27 AprilIn an initial phase commencing on 27 April, the Federal Council intends to ease measures on businesses where there is only a low level of direct contact, where precautionary measures can easily be put in place, and where there will be no significant movements of people. Measures regarding the inpatient medical sector will be eased, meaning that hospitals will again be free to carry out all types of procedure. Outpatient medical practices will also be allowed to resume normal operation and carry out all medical procedures, including non-urgent procedures. This covers dental, physiotherapy and medical massage practices, and should prevent the negative consequences that could arise as a result of people foregoing treatments and examinations. Businesses offering personal services involving physical contact may also reopen, for example hairdressing salons, massage practices, tattoo and cosmetic studios. Florists, DIY stores and garden centres may also open again, as can unstaffed public facilities such as car washes. Lastly, the restriction whereby funerals may only be attended by close family will also be lifted. From 27 April, restrictions on the range of products that can be sold at grocery stores will be lifted. Shops stocking goods other than essential everyday items in their stores may then resume selling these too.Second and third phase: 11 May and 8 JuneIn phase two, which is set to commence on 11 May, it is planned that schools for children of compulsory-school age, shops and markets will reopen. The Federal Council will decide on whether to proceed with phase two on 29 April. In phase three, set to commence on 8 June, upper secondary schools, vocational schools and higher education institutions will be allowed to resume face-to-face teaching. At the same time, entertainment and leisure establishments such as museums, libraries, botanical gardens and zoos may reopen, and restrictions on gatherings could be relaxed. The Federal Council will take a decision regarding the details of this phase on 27 May. The Federal Council has not yet determined further phases. A decision as to when large-scale events will again be allowed to go ahead will be taken at one of its next meetings.Schedule depends on how the epidemic develops Moving from one phase to the next depends on there being no significant increase in COVID-19 cases. Sufficient time has to be allowed between each phase so that the effects can be observed. The criteria are the number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths, and hospital occupancy rates. As soon as the number of cases in Switzerland has fallen sufficiently, the cantons will resume the consistent tracing of infection chains: infected persons should be detected, treated and placed in isolation at an early stage, transmission chains should be identified and further transmissions prevented. To this end, an extended testing strategy, a contact tracing concept and an app providing information about contacts with infected persons will be developed. The rules on hygiene and social distancing continue to be important and will remain in place. People at especially high risk should continue to stay at home.Protection for employees at especially high riskWith the gradual resumption of certain services and operations, employees at especially high risk must be well protected. The Federal Council has therefore modified the definition of people at especially high risk and protective measures.Employers have a duty to allow staff at especially high risk to work from home, if necessary by allowing them to perform appropriate alternative tasks. If it is imperative for an employee to be physically present, the employer must take steps to protect that person by adapting procedures or the working environment. A person at especially high risk may refuse work if they consider the risk to their health to be too great. If it is not possible for the person to work at home or at the workplace, the employer must place th e employee on leave while continuing to pay their wages. The employer may request a medical certificate stating why the employee is considered to be at especially high risk.In view of the epidemiological situation in the canton of Ticino, the Federal Council has allowed the authorities to restrict the activity of certain economic sectors until 26 April.

Coronavirus: Federal Council does not want a general obligation to wear a mask,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78874.html,2020-04-22,"Bern, 22.04.2020 - Over the next few weeks, the Federal Council will gradually relax the measures to protect against the new coronavirus. There is no general obligation to wear a mask. Keeping a safe distance and washing hands remain the most effective protective measures. These are the provisions the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) informed the Federal Council of at its meeting of 22 April 2020. The branches and businesses are obliged to accompany the relaxation with protection concepts which may include the use of masks. Starting next week, the Confederation will supply one million hygienic masks to leading retailers every day for two weeks to support sufficient supply. Healthy people still do not need to wear masks in public spaces. The previous rules of conduct regarding distance and hygiene are still crucial to protect against the corona virus. As before, it is advised to stay at home, especially for sick people. The gradual relaxation of measures to combat the corona virus should be accompanied by protection concepts. These have to be developed by the branches themselves and can include the recommendation to wear a mask. All companies and event organizers must have a protection concept that is based either on an industry concept or on the requirements of the FOPH and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco). The cantons are responsible for checking compliance with the protection concepts on site.Mask protects othersHygienic masks primarily protect other people and only to a limited extent the person who wears them. That is why the mask is only useful in combination with physical distancing and hygienic rules. The Federal Office of Public Health is thus following the recommendations of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Medical masks (FFP2, FFP3) are still primarily intended for medical personnel who have been trained in their correct use. Textile masks (community masks or mouth guards) should not be home-made. Industrially manufactured textile masks should meet the recommendations of the Science Task Force Covid.Purchase of masksHealthcare providers, companies and private households are responsible for the procurement of their own masks. The Confederation is in contact with retailers to ensure they can ensure sufficient supply of masks in the coming weeks and gradually expand it. As an initial impulse, the army pharmacy will be supplying one million hygienic masks to leading retailers every day for two weeks starting next week. If procurement cannot be met through normal channels, the Confederation provides subsidies, if possible. To date, the army pharmacy has distributed 21 million hygienic masks to the cantons. The Federal Councils current inventory comprises 18 million hygienic and 1.2 million FFP2 masks. These numbers will be continuously expanded.Range restrictions in the retail trade remainThe Federal Council also decided today that the existing product range restrictions in grocery stores continue to apply. In doing so, it reverts its decision of April 16 to ease the restrictions of the product range. As part of the transition strategy, the Federal Council had decided that as of April 27, everyday goods and other goods may be sold if they are in the same sales area of grocery products. This decision had raised many questions, including unequal treatment of large retailers vis-à-vis specialist shops. These are expected to reopen on May 11th.Limitation of medically non-urgent treatments and examinationsAfter consultation with the cantons, the Federal Council today also regulated the question of restricting medically non-urgent treatments and examinations in hospitals. On April 16, the Federal Council had lifted a corresponding national ban as of April 27 and allowed the hospitals to carry out so-called election interventions. The cantons are still obliged to ensure sufficient capacities for the treatment of patients with COVID 19. Cantons can now chose to restrict interventions themselves and, as previously, oblige public and private hospitals to provide additional capacities. The hospitals must also keep a sufficient supply of important medical products for COVID-19 patients and for other urgent medical treatments.Due to the epidemiological situation, the Federal Council authorized the Canton of Ticino to extend the restrictions on economic sectors until May 3, 2020. Healthy people still do not need to wear masks in public spaces. The previous rules of conduct regarding distance and hygiene are still crucial to protect against the corona virus.

Corona virus: Switzerland set to take part in 2021 Olympic Games and Dubai World Expo,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78927.html,2020-04-29,"Bern, 29.04.2020 - Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of global events are being postponed – including the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo and Expo 2020 in Dubai. The Federal Council has confirmed that Switzerland will be showcasing itself at both major events which will now be held in 2021. It also emphasized the importance of such events in terms of economic recovery for the international markets. The International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee and the responsible authorities in Japan have decided to hold the Olympic Games from 23 July to 8 August 2021 and the Paralympic Games from 24 August to 5 September 2021. For Expo Dubai 2020, the Executive Committee of the Bureau International des Expositions requested at its meeting on 21 April 2020 that member states postpone the event for a year. The proposal is expected to be adopted before the end of May 2020. In spite of these postponements, which also entail additional costs for Switzerland, the Federal Council views such large-scale events as an opportunity to position Switzerland and promote its economy, particularly in the post-COVID-19 phase. It has therefore confirmed Switzerland's presence at the Games and the Expo and has approved the additional related costs. In light of today's decision, the Federal Council has instructed Presence Switzerland at the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) to continue preparations for the House of Switzerland at the Olympic Games in Tokyo and the Swiss Pavilion at the Dubai Expo with a new budgetary framework.The additional related costs amount to CHF 2 million (CHF 0.5 million for the House of Switzerland in Tokyo and CHF 1.5 million for the Swiss Pavilion in Dubai) and will be offset within the FDFA. The sponsors for both events have also reaffirmed their interest in participating in 2021.

Coronavirus: Restrictions on entry to be gradually relaxed from 11 May,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78940.html,2020-04-29,"Bern, 29.04.2020 - The Federal Council plans to gradually relax the restrictions on entry imposed as a result of the coronavirus crisis in step with the gradual reopening of the economy. From 11 May onwards, applications submitted by workers from the EU/EFTA and third countries before 25 March will be processed (the backlog will be reduced). From this date, it should also be possible for family members of Swiss citizens and EU citizens to enter Switzerland. Border controls, however, will remain in place. The Federal Council has tasked the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) with preparing these measures to ease the lockdown. Protecting the Swiss public against the spread of the coronavirus continues to be the highest priority for the Federal Council. Any easing of the restrictions on entry into Switzerland or on allowing foreign citizens to work or stay in the country will only take place once the epidemiological situation permits. That said, the Federal Council also wants to minimise the negative impact of restricting entry into the country on the economy. By easing the restrictions gradually, the impact of each step can be assessed and decisions made about further stages, considering at all times developments in the epidemiological situation and on the labour market. These measures are being closely discussed with Switzerland's neighbouring countries. The following initial steps to ease the lockdown on movement of people will come into effect on 11 May:The cantons will process all applications for residence permits and cross-border commuter permits submitted by workers from an EU or EFTA member state before the introduction of entry restrictions (25 March). The same applies for notification of commencement of work for short deployments with an employer in Switzerland and for cross-border services provided for a maximum of 90 days a year.New notifications for cross-border services will again be processed in accordance with the usual terms of the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons provided the service provision is based on a written contract signed before 25 March 2020. For example, a mechanic from Germany may install a machine previously ordered by a Swiss company.Workers from third countries who already have a permit to work in Switzerland, but who were not issued a visa because of the restrictions imposed on entry, are now permitted to enter the country.Applications to employ persons from third countries submitted before the restrictions on this category came into effect (19 March) will now be processed. They will be approved provided the provisions of the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act are met and the person(s) in question can actually take up the position.Family reunification for family members of Swiss citizens is again possible. The same applies for family members of people from EU/EFTA states living in Switzerland.The current border controls will continue. Additional border crossings will be opened in order to avoid excessive waiting times. Flights from abroad will still only be able to land at Zurich, Geneva or Basel airports so that sufficient border controls can be made.  All other restrictions on cross-border movement will remain in place for the time being. However, the Federal Council has already discussed a further easing of the lockdown in this area. A decision has been taken in principle that from 8 June it will be possible to process applications from all workers from EU and EFTA states who are actually able to take up their employment in Switzerland, if the epidemiological situation so permits. This second step in the easing of the lockdown will be taken in consultation with the cantons and social partners. The requirement to give notification of job vacancies, which has been temporarily suspended, will also be reactivated.

Coronavirus: Federal Council to ease further measures from 11 May,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78948.html,2020-04-29,"Bern, 29.04.2020 - At its meeting on 29 April, the Federal Council decided to further ease the measures introduced to protect the population against the coronavirus. From Monday, 11 May, shops, restaurants markets, museums and libraries will be allowed to reopen, classes can be held again in primary and lower secondary schools, and sports training sessions will be allowed. There will be a significant increase in scheduled public transport services. This year baccalaureate examination grades may be based on continuous assessment, although the cantons will ultimately decide whether written baccalaureate examinations will be held. The easing of measures is conditional on the businesses and institutions concerned taking suitable precautionary measures. Strict compliance with hygiene and social distancing rules remains essential. In parallel to this easing of measures, restrictions on entering Switzerland will also be relaxed. It is further planned to reintroduce comprehensive contact tracing for all new infections from 11 May. The spread of the new coronavirus in Switzerland has continued to slow. Results show that the public is cooperating well with measuresto combat the virus. The Federal Council has therefore decided to further ease measures taken to protect the population against the coronavirus. In doing so, it is going further than originally announced on 16 April. From 11 May, not only will shops, markets and primaryand lower secondary schools be allowed to reopen, but also museums, libraries and restaurants.The sequence of the individual steps is based on a risk analysis. The Federal Council has taken account of the effect that relaxing specific measures will have on people at especially high risk, how it may increase the level of contact with others and increase numbers and movements of people in public spaces. It has also considered the ease with which precautionary measures can be taken, and the impact of measures on the economy.Rules on hygiene and social distancing still applyThe course taken by the epidemic from now on will largely depend on how well the public continues to comply with the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These rules still apply. The Federal Council will closely monitor the impact of easing measures on the development of the epidemic. The steps being taken to ease the measures in place are conditional on suitable precautionary measures being implemented. All businesses and institutions must draw up a plan for such measures, which must be based either on a model devised for their sector, or on requirements set out by the Federal Office of Public Health FOPH and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO.The Federal Council will decide at its meeting on 27 May on a third phase of easing measures from 8 June. Decisions are expected to be taken on lifting the ban on gatherings of more than five people, on classroom teaching in baccalaureate schools and higher education institutions, on reopening cultural venues, sports facilities and mountain transport systems, and on holding religious services. It will also discuss ending the extraordinary situation that it declared under the Epidemics Act. On 26 June, the Federal Council plans to take further decisions for the summer, based on the results of its monitoring programme.Cautious reopening of restaurants from 11 MayFrom 11 May, restaurants will also be able to reopen, subject to strict requirements. In a first phase, no more than four people or a group of parents with children will be allowed to sit at each table. All guests must be seated, and groups of guests must sit at least two metres from the next or be separated by suitable partitioning. The Federal Council will decide on further steps to be taken on 27 May. The gradual reopening of restaurants will depend on precautionary measures being taken and has been discussed with sector representatives.Cantons to decide how classes will be taughtPrimary and lower secondary schools will be able to recommence classroom teaching from 11 May. The FOPH and the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Directors of Education have drawn up requirements for the precautionary measures to be taken in consultation with the Science Taskforce and other experts. The cantons and communes have until 11 May to make arrangements for implementing these measures, taking account of local circumstances in each case. Schools will be allowed to be flexible in their approach to classroom teaching. At baccalaureate schools and at vocational colleges and higher education institutions, classes involving up to five students, including music lessons can resume from 11 May. Exams can be held, provided the rules on hygiene and social distancing are respected. Classes involving larger groups should be possible from 8 June. Academic and professional baccalaureates based on continuous assessmentCantonal baccalaureate schools will be permitted to dispense with written baccalaureate examinations this year, following a decision of the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Directors of Education (EDK) not to hold oral examinations (see separate press release). The Federal Council is thus responding to a request from the EDK. The decision has also been taken to award the professional baccalaureate in 2020 entirely on the basis of continuous assessment grades. The federal government has sole responsibility for taking this decision.Museums, libraries and archives to open earlier than expectedThe Federal Council has decided that not only shops and markets, but also museums, libraries and archives should be allowed to reopen from 11 May. In these establishments, implementing the rules on hygiene and social distancing is straightforward and it is easy to control people's movements. Botanical gardens and zoos will remain closed, but are expected to reopen on 8 June.Federal Council permits sports training sessions from 11 MayThe Federal Council is also easing measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that have been taken in relation to sports activities (see separate press release). From 11 May, recreational sports training can resume for small groups of no more than five people, provided no physical contact is involved, and the rules on hygiene and distancing are respected. In competitive and professional sports, the restrictions will be less stringent, and training sessions involving more than five people will be permitted. The Federal Council has also decided to permit matches in the professional leagues to be held behind closed doors from 8 June.Entry restrictions to be gradually eased from 11 MayThe Federal Council is also planning to gradually relax coronavirus-related restrictions on entry to Switzerland at the same time as the various sectors of the economy are allowed to reopen (see separate press release). In a first step, from 11 May, it is planned to process applications submitted before 25 March by workers from the EU/EFTA area and from third countries. For Swiss and EU citizens, family reunification in Switzerland will become possible again from 11 May. Border controls will however remain in place.Large-scale events to remain banned until the end of AugustThe Federal Council has also decided that large-scale events involving more than 1000 people will remain banned until the end of August. By doing so, it aims to create certainty for those planning such events. The risk of transmitting the virus is far higher at large events and tracing all those who may be infected is impossible. Normally the rules on hygiene and social distancing cannot be complied with. The Federal Council will reassess the situation before the summer holiday season. On 27 May, it will also decide on the date from which smaller events with fewer than 1000 participants will be allowed again.Tracing for all new infectionsIn order to contain the epidemic in the longer term, the federal government has drawn up a plan for the containment phase. As soon as the number the new infections has fallen sufficiently, all cantons will be required to conduct interviews to trace transmission chains across the country (contact tracing). The aim is to identify persons infected at an early stage and ensure that anyone with symptoms can be tested, not simply those who are at high risk or who have already been admitted to hospital, as is currently the case. Persons who test positive will be placed in isolation, while those who have been in contact with them will be notified and placed in quarantine. These measures must be complied with in order to break the chain of infection.The testing of persons with mild symptoms who are not in any risk category is one of measures taken to contain the epidemic. It will therefore be paid for by the cantons. The cost of testing persons with severe symptoms or at increased risk of complications will still be covered by mandatory health insurance. Due to rapid technical advances, the FDHA has also decided to reduce the tariff for analyses charged under mandatory health insurance to CHF 95 with effect from 30 April.Voluntary app to help contain the epidemicThe population should also be provided with a digital application that uses Bluetooth technology to notify users if they have spent too long in close proximity to a person who is infected. This app is currently being developed by the Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich andLausanne on behalf of the federal government and the Science Task Force. Persons alerted by the app can obtain further advice by calling the FOPH Infoline. Using the app is voluntary: users are the only persons who can see their own data and no personal data or location details will be used. Furthermore, the app will only be used while the crisis is ongoing. The Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner and the National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics has recommended that these basic principles be respected. The spread of the new coronavirus in Switzerland has continued to slow. Results show that the public is cooperating well with measuresto combat the virus. The Federal Council has therefore decided to further ease measures taken to protect the population against the coronavirus. In doing so, it is going further than originally announced on 16 April. From 11 May, not only will shops, markets and primaryand lower secondary schools be allowed to reopen, but also museums, libraries and restaurants. The sequence of the individual steps is based on a risk analysis. The Federal Council has taken account of the effect that relaxing specific measures will have on people at especially high risk, how it may increase the level of contact with others and increase numbers and movements of people in public spaces. It has also considered the ease with which precautionary measures can be taken, and the impact of measures on the economy. Rules on hygiene and social distancing still applyThe course taken by the epidemic from now on will largely depend on how well the public continues to comply with the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These rules still apply. The Federal Council will closely monitor the impact of easing measures on the development of the epidemic. The steps being taken to ease the measures in place are conditional on suitable precautionary measures being implemented. All businesses and institutions must draw up a plan for such measures, which must be based either on a model devised for their sector, or on requirements set out by the Federal Office of Public Health FOPH and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO.

Switzerland to provide CHF 400 million in support of international action to combat the coronavirus,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78956.html,2020-04-30,"Bern, 30.04.2020 - Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. The pandemic is compounding an already precarious situation in countries beset by poverty, armed conflict or natural disasters. To mitigate the consequences of the pandemic, the Federal Council has decided to provide the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) with a CHF 200 million interest-free loan and to contribute CHF 25 million to an IMF rapid credit facility to help countries address the pandemic. A further CHF 175 million is to be allocated to help strengthen internationally active organisations and international cooperation to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. With these funds, Switzerland is showing solidarity during the global crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic is having a profound impact on everyone's lives. Lockdown restrictions on business activity are threatening livelihoods in developing countries in particular. When the world's poorest lose their jobs or are prevented from going to work, they cannot feed their families. Most have no job security or the benefit of a robust social safety net to protect them in a crisis such as this one. The risk of social unrest is growing and millions more will lose their livelihoods and have no alternative but to leave their home and country. It is in Switzerland's interests to address the causes of forced displacement. Contributions to internationally active organisations to combat the pandemicThe Federal Council is responding to urgent appeals for financial support from the UN, the WHO, the ICRC, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the G20 and other organisations to help them maintain their ability to address the pandemic. The major internationally active organisations need funds to take additional measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to mitigate the economic and social consequences of the pandemic.The Federal Council has agreed to contribute CHF 400 million to international efforts, particularly in developing countries. As a first step, it wants Switzerland to grant the ICRC an interest-free loan of up to CHF 200 million, repayable within seven years. In addition, it has proposed to contribute CHF 25 million to the IMF's Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust. Parliament will take a decision on both loan and contribution in the summer session. In May, the Federal Council will decide on additional contributions of up to CHF 175 million for various internationally active organisations.This Federal Council's decision also responds to a motion put forward by the National Council Foreign Affairs Committee calling for a CHF 100 million increase in humanitarian aid credits for 2020.Swift and effective international cooperation responseSwitzerland has responded quickly and effectively to the crisis through its development cooperation programmes. The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) has made targeted adjustments to its programmes, particularly those being implemented by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), to address the pandemic. The Federal Department of Economics, Education and Research has, for its part, adapted programmes currently being undertaken by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. Over CHF 100 million in additional funding has been allocated from the current budget. These funds will be used to strengthen the work of organisations such as the UN (including the WHO), the ICRC and the IFRC as well as humanitarian and pandemic-related SDC projects. Swiss Humanitarian Aid has already delivered relief supplies at the request of affected countries.

Federal Councillor Karin Keller-Sutter has reached agreement on this move following talks with the interior ministers of these three neighbouring countries. She advised the Federal Council of the agreement at its meeting on 13 May 2020. The Federal Council decided on 29 April that it would  gradually relax corona-related entry restrictions in line with the  easing of economic measures. The first easing of measures took effect on  11 May 2020. Over the past few days, Federal Councillor Keller-Sutter  has discussed a further move to relax measures in several telephone  conversations with the interior ministers of Germany, France and  Austria, Horst Seehofer, Christophe Castaner and Karl Nehammer. All  three countries, like Switzerland, are currently in a transitional phase  and in a comparable epidemiological situation.

Provided the pandemic  situation in the countries allows, this move should take effect on 15  June. In the meantime, specific reciprocal solutions will be found without  delay for unmarried binational couples and other categories of persons.  The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) will publish more information  as soon as the details of these solutions have been agreed.

"Coronavirus: Switzerland responds to humanitarian needs and supports the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79094.html,2020-05-13,"Bern, 13.05.2020 - At its meeting of 13 May 2020, the Federal Council approved the allocation of CHF 175 million for the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds will be used for humanitarian aid, the development and production of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, and efforts aimed at ensuring equitable access to these medical solutions worldwide. The CHF 175 million is part of a CHF 400 million package approved by the Federal Council two weeks ago. On 29 April 2020, the Federal Council approved CHF 400 million in support of international efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds are intended to support people in poverty and need, especially in developing countries. Switzerland accordingly decided to provide the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) with a CHF 200 million interest-free loan and to contribute CHF 25 million to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rapid credit facility. At its meeting of 13 May 2020, the Federal Council decided on the use of the remaining CHF 175 million.Focus on humanitarian aid, innovation and healthOf this CHF 175 million, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has already allocated CHF 52 million, including contributions to the UN and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement as well as bilateral aid consisting of relief supplies and other assistance in humanitarian crisis regions. Switzerland has also provided the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations with CHF 10 million for research into a vaccine against the COVID-19 virus. At its meeting earlier today, the Federal Council also decided to support additional initiatives: - CHF 60 million has been earmarked for the development and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Half of these funds will go Gavi, a Geneva-based alliance specialising in vaccine supply in developing countries. The other half will go to the Wellcome Trust and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which promote access to COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics in developing countries. - CHF 50.5 million will be used to meet the growing need for humanitarian aid worldwide – both in response to emergency appeals by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the UN and for bilateral aid.- Switzerland is also providing CHF 2.5 million to the World Health Organization's efforts to coordinate the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is in Switzerland's interests to ensure a strong international response to this pandemic, which knows no borders. This Federal Council decision also responds to a motion put forward by the National Council Foreign Affairs Committee calling for a CHF 100 million increase in humanitarian aid credits for 2020.As a result of the current situation, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) will be able to save about CHF 20 million by the end of the year. This money will be spent on humanitarian aid provided as part of efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.Developing countries particularly at riskCOVID-19 is not only affecting people's health, but also economic and social life. It is hitting developing countries especially hard: many of them do not have a functioning healthcare system, and their populations do not have savings, regulated working conditions or a stable social security system to protect them against the loss of their livelihoods. Loss of livelihood leads to an increased risk of unrest, forced displacement and irregular migration. It is therefore very much in Switzerland's interests to provide rapid and unbureaucratic assistance to people in poverty and need. As the host state of a large number of international organisations based in Geneva, Switzerland is well equipped to make a major contribution to international efforts to mitigate the impact of this global pandemic.

Given the particular importance of the media for democracy in Switzerland, a number of broadly backed motions were submitted during the extraordinary session of Parliament requesting immediate financial assistance of CHF 57.5 million. The Federal Council consequently adopted two emergency ordinances at its meeting on 20 May. The complete text is available in German, French and Italian.

"Coronavirus: religious services possible again, legal basis for SwissCovid app",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79204.html,2020-05-20,"Bern, 20.05.2020 - Religious services can take place again as of the 28th May 2020. In order to achieve this, the various faith communities must develop protection concepts. This decision was taken by the Federal Council at its meeting on 20th May 2020. It also approved an urgent amendment to the Epidemics Act for the attention of parliament as the legal basis for the SwissCovid App. Furthermore, it instructed the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) to ensure early access to vaccines. Faith communities should be able to resume their common religious life. From the 28th of May 2020, all services and celebrations of all faiths will once again be permitted. The religious communities have one week to work out protection concepts and to ensure the tracing of possible chains of infection. A framework protection concept has been drawn up by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Legal basis for SwissCovid-AppIn addition, the Federal Council has approved the legal basis for the new SwissCovid app. The amended Epidemics Act gives the FOPH the right to operate a proximity tracing system to contain the spread of the virus. The data processed in the SwissCovid app is used solely to notify the participating persons if they were potentially exposed to the corona virus. The Swiss-Covid app supplements the traditional contact tracing of the cantons, i.e. the tracing and interruption of infection chains.The use of the app is voluntary and participation or non-participation does not result in any disadvantages or advantages. Data protection is guaranteed at all times. The data is stored decentrally and the system does not collect location data. The technical details and source code are public. As soon as the system is no longer required to combat the coronavirus, the Federal Council will take it out of service.The bill is to be debated by parliament in the summer session in June. If the amendment is approved, the SwissCovid app can be introduced throughout Switzerland before the end of June. In the coming weeks the app will be tested in a pilot phase. Securing access to vaccinesThe Federal Council wants to ensure that the research and development of a vaccine is accelerated and that the Swiss population has the fastest possible access to a safe and effective vaccine. At the same time, Switzerland wants to contribute to fair access to such a vaccine for all countries. The Federal Council expects that immunological protection in Switzerland, as in other countries, is likely to be low after the first epidemic wave has subsided. The worldwide demand for vaccines will therefore be correspondingly high. The Federal Council has instructed the FDHA, together with the Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), to start contract negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. The Federal Council is expecting costs of around 300 million Swiss francs for the necessary vaccine doses and to ensure their availability. It is expected that this amount be covered by credits already approved for the fight against coronavirus. Normal working and rest periods will again apply for hospital staffIn addition, the statutory working hours and rest periods for hospital staff will again apply from the beginning of June, as the situation in most hospital departments has now normalised. Faith communities should be able to resume their common religious life. From the 28th of May 2020, all services and celebrations of all faiths will once again be permitted. The religious communities have one week to work out protection concepts and to ensure the tracing of possible chains of infection. A framework protection concept has been drawn up by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Legal basis for SwissCovid-AppIn addition, the Federal Council has approved the legal basis for the new SwissCovid app. The amended Epidemics Act gives the FOPH the right to operate a proximity tracing system to contain the spread of the virus. The data processed in the SwissCovid app is used solely to notify the participating persons if they were potentially exposed to the corona virus. The Swiss-Covid app supplements the traditional contact tracing of the cantons, i.e. the tracing and interruption of infection chains. The use of the app is voluntary and participation or non-participation does not result in any disadvantages or advantages. Data protection is guaranteed at all times. The data is stored decentrally and the system does not collect location data. The technical details and source code are public. As soon as the system is no longer required to combat the coronavirus, the Federal Council will take it out of service. The bill is to be debated by parliament in the summer session in June. If the amendment is approved, the SwissCovid app can be introduced throughout Switzerland before the end of June. In the coming weeks the app will be tested in a pilot phase. Securing access to vaccinesThe Federal Council wants to ensure that the research and development of a vaccine is accelerated and that the Swiss population has the fastest possible access to a safe and effective vaccine. At the same time, Switzerland wants to contribute to fair access to such a vaccine for all countries. The Federal Council expects that immunological protection in Switzerland, as in other countries, is likely to be low after the first epidemic wave has subsided. The worldwide demand for vaccines will therefore be correspondingly high. The Federal Council has instructed the FDHA, together with the Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), to start contract negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. The Federal Council is expecting costs of around 300 million Swiss francs for the necessary vaccine doses and to ensure their availability. It is expected that this amount be covered by credits already approved for the fight against coronavirus. Normal working and rest periods will again apply for hospital staffIn addition, the statutory working hours and rest periods for hospital staff will again apply from the beginning of June, as the situation in most hospital departments has now normalised."

Coronavirus: Further easing of entry restrictions from 8 June,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79248.html,2020-05-27,"Bern, 27.05.2020 - The Federal Council is to further relax entry restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions will be lifted in step with the reopening of the economy. From 8 June, the cantons will begin processing applications from workers from the EU/EFTA member states. In addition, Swiss companies will be allowed to employ highly skilled workers from third countries if this is in the public interest, or if they are urgently required. To benefit the domestic workforce, companies will again be required to give notification of job vacancies, a measure that was temporarily suspended during the lockdown. Lastly, the Federal Council plans to lift all travel restrictions and re-establish the free movement of persons across the Schengen area no later than 6 July. Border controls with Germany, Austria and France will be lifted as early as 15 June, as previously announced. At its meeting on 27 May, the Federal Council decided to  further relax the entry restrictions imposed to protect the Swiss  population against the spread of the coronavirus. The decision comes in  light of the positive developments with respect to COVID-19. The move is  in line with the next step to reopen the economy in order to minimise  the negative economic impact of the crisis. This will allow companies in  Switzerland to once again recruit urgently needed workers from EU/EFTA  member states and from third countries if none are available from the  Swiss workforce. At the same time, the Federal Council has decided to reintroduce the  requirement of giving notification of employment vacancies, allowing job  seekers in Switzerland a time lead in the job application process. To  promote the domestic workforce, the Federal Council intends to implement  the package of supporting measures approved in May 2019.                                                Easing of restrictions from 8 June                       The second stage of easing the lockdown follows in  consultation with the cantons, the social partners and neighbouring  states. From 8 June, the following measures will come into force: The cantons will again process all applications for a residence or  cross-border commuter permit from workers from EU/EFTA member states.  The same applies for notification of commencement of work for short-term  deployments with an employer in Switzerland and for cross-border  services for a maximum duration of 90 days per year.   Applications to employ workers from third countries will also be  processed again. Admission will be possible if the work assignment is in  the public interest and, for example, is necessary to the national  economic supply, or if a company urgently requires this skilled labour  from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or  performed abroad.   Family reunification will be possible again for all persons with a  permanent residence permit, a residence permit, a short stay permit or  who have been temporarily admitted to Switzerland, under the usual  conditions.   School pupils and students will be allowed to enter Switzerland to  begin, continue or finish their studies, regardless of their  nationality. This does not apply, however, to education and further  training lasting less than 90 days.   The cantons will begin processing applications again for a short  stay permit from persons who wish to enter into marriage or a registered  partnership with a Swiss or with a foreign national who has a residence  or permanent residence permit.   The Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA, in consultation with  the Federal Department of Justice and Police FDJP and the Federal  Department of Finance FDF, may order a medical examination at the border  for certain groups of people, including a temperature reading, a health  questionnaire or quarantine, for any person from a high-risk country  listed in the COVID-19 Ordinance who wishes to enter Switzerland.   Passenger flights from abroad will no longer be channelled to Zurich, Geneva or Basel airport. The Federal Council eased entry restrictions for the first time with  effect from 11 May. Since then the cantons have been processing  applications from workers from EU/EFTA member states that were submitted  before entry restrictions were imposed. The same applies to the  notification of cross-border services, to applications to employ workers  from third countries, and to business meetings that cannot be  postponed. Family reunification for Swiss citizens and EU nationals has  also been allowed again since that date.                                                Further easing of cross-broder travel from 15 June                       The Federal Council has discussed the further easing of  restrictions after 8 June. The relevant ministries in Switzerland,  Germany, France and Austria agreed at the beginning of May to lift all  travel restrictions between their respective countries on 15 June if the  pandemic situation permits. In light of the positive trend with respect  to the coronavirus in all four countries, the FDJP, in consultation  with the FDHA and the Federal Departmenf of Foreign Affairs FDFA, will  take the necessary steps to reopen the borders from 15 June, as  previously announced, thereby abolishing all travel restrictions to  these countries and re-establishing the free movment of persons. Italy declared the lifting of internal border checks with its  neighbours with effect from 3 June. Switzerland has informed Italy that  in its view it is too early to lift border controls with Italy on that  date. The Federal Council intends to coordinate that step with Italy, as  well as possible health checks at the border with Italy and other  neighbouring countries to Italy in the coming weeks. In doing so, the  Federal Council will involve the border cantons, in particular Ticino,  in these measures.                                                 Travel restrictions to be lifted for all Schengen states from 6 July                       If developments with respect to the pandemic in Switzerland  and in the EU/EFTA permit, restrictions on entering, working and living  in Switzerland will be lifted for all Schengen states from mid-June and  no later than 6 July. The FDJP therfore plans to successively update the  list of high-risk countries, in agreement with the FDHA, the FDFA and  the EU/EFTA member states. The aim is to lift all travel restrictions  and re-establish the complete free movement of persons across the  Schengen area by this date.

Controls at Swiss borders with these states will end on this date and full free movement of persons will be restored with all EU/EFTA states and with the United Kingdom. The Federal Council has noted the decision of the Federal  Department of Justice and Police FDJP to remove Schengen States from the  list of high-risk countries, and has approved amendments to the COVID  Ordinance that reintroduce rights of free movement. By removing the  Schengen states from the list of high-risk countries and areas, all  restrictions imposed on persons entering Switzerland from the Schengen  Area have been lifted. This includes the ban on importing goods for  private use that have been purchased on a shopping trip abroad. In  addition, all the border crossings that are currently closed will be  reopened. The Federal Customs Administration FCA will continue to carry  out risk-based controls to prevent smuggling and cross-border crime.

Although the UK is not part of the Schengen area  either, the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons continues to apply  there until 31 December 2020. These six countries will remain on the  high-risk list after 15 June, which means that restrictions will  continue to apply to third country nationals wishing to enter  Switzerland from these countries. However, persons with rights of free  movement will be allowed to enter Switzerland again from 15 June; this  includes citizens of these six countries, their family members  regardless of their nationality and third-country nationals who are  posted to Switzerland for a maximum of 90 days in any year by a company  based in these countries. In view of the currently positive situation with regard to the  pandemic in Switzerland and in most of Europe, the interior ministers of  the Schengen States agreed last week to end controls at Schengen  internal borders as quickly as possible.

Coronavirus: Move towards normalisation and simplified basic rules to protect the population,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79522.html,2020-06-19,"Bern, 19.06.2020 - As of Monday, 22 June, the measures put in place to tackle the coronavirus will for the most part be lifted. Only the ban on large-scale events will remain in place until the end of August. This follows the decisions taken by the Federal Council at its meeting on 19 June in view of the continuing low level of new cases. All publicly accessible venues must have a set of precautionary measures in place. However, the Federal Council has simplified the applicable requirements. Hand hygiene and keeping an appropriate distance remain the most important protective measures; the Federal Council continues to rely on the public to behave responsibly. The Federal Council began to introduce measures to protect against the coronavirus on 28 February, and gradually tightened those measures up until 21 March, before gradually easing them again in three phases from 27 April. The number of new infections, hospitalisations and deaths has continued to fall despite measures being eased, and has stabilised at a low level.Events for up to 1000 people possibleIn a fourth phase, the Federal Council is now lifting most of the remaining restrictions as of 22 June. Events and gatherings for up to 1000 people will once again be permitted. However, contact tracing must be possible at all times. Event organisers must ensure that the maximum number of people that may need to be contacted does not exceed 300. This can be achieved by dividing the venue into sectors. The cantons may see fit to apply a lower number. Large-scale events for more than 1000 people will be permitted from the beginning of September, as long as there is no deterioration in the epidemiological situation. Those attending will also have to be placed in sectors.As of 22 June, there will no longer be a requirement for customers at restaurants to be seated. The Federal Council is also lifting the fixed closing time for restaurants, discos and nightclubs.Simplified basic rules for allFollowing the steps to ease measures, the Federal Council is relying even more heavily on the public to behave responsibly; people should continue to follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. The Federal Council has also simplified and harmonised requirements for sets of precautionary measures. All publicly accessible venues must have a set of precautionary measures in place. There are to be no special rules for individual categories of establishments, events or educational institutions. The same requirements will apply for all sets of precautionary measures; there are to be no more model sets of precautionary measures.In view of the low number of cases, the Federal Council is reducing the minimum distance that should be kept between two people from 2 metres to 1.5 metres. There is a significant risk of infection if individuals spend longer than 15 minutes at a distance of under 1.5 metres. If masks are worn or partitions are in place, the distance may be further reduced. At events with fixed seating, such as at concerts or in cinemas, it is sufficient to leave a free space. If it is not possible to implement distancing measures at an event or in schools, attendance lists must be kept so that contacts can be traced in the event that someone tests positive for coronavirus.Masks: Always have one with you on public transport, mandatory at demonstrationsMasks can significantly reduce the risk of infection. Members of the public are therefore strongly recommended to wear a face mask when using public transport if it is not possible to maintain the necessary distance. All travellers should always have a face mask with them. There is no upper limit for the number of people able to attend a demonstration, but it will be mandatory to wear a face mask. This change concerning political and civil society demonstrations will apply from Saturday, 20 June.Recommendation to work from home liftedThe decision as to whether staff should work from home or return to the office is now one for employers. The recommendation to work from home is to be lifted, as are the guidelines on protecting people at especially high risk. These individuals may also return to the workplace, however the employer is required protect the health of staff by putting in place appropriate measures. Employment legislation applies. The simplified basic rules also apply to trade and industry, as well as to service businesses not accessible to the public. No sets of precautionarymeasures are required.Managing a renewed increase in infectionsFollowing today's downgrading of the situation from extraordinary, the Federal Council discussed ways of managing a possible second wave. In contrast to the first wave, the prime responsibility in the event of a renewed increase in COVID-19 cases should rest with the cantons. Cantons that observe an increase in the number of cases of infection should be able to take suitable measures to manage the situation, focusing on those measures that have proven to be particularly effective against the spread of new infections. In order to be ready to manage an outbreak of new infections, the Federal Council issued the departments with a series of tasks to enable it, for example, to have rapid access to detailed data, or ensure the supply of necessary medication and protective equipment.At its meeting today, the Federal Council also acknowledged the final report of the Federal Council Coronavirus Crisis Unit, and took the decision to dissolve the unit to coincide with the downgrading of the situation. The KSBC was set up by the Federal Council on 20 March to coordinate the efforts of the government departments, the Federal Chancellery, the cantons and other crisis units. The Federal Council began to introduce measures to protect against the coronavirus on 28 February, and gradually tightened those measures up until 21 March, before gradually easing them again in three phases from 27 April. The number of new infections, hospitalisations and deaths has continued to fall despite measures being eased, and has stabilised at a low level. Events for up to 1000 people possibleIn a fourth phase, the Federal Council is now lifting most of the remaining restrictions as of 22 June. Events and gatherings for up to 1000 people will once again be permitted. However, contact tracing must be possible at all times. Event organisers must ensure that the maximum number of people that may need to be contacted does not exceed 300. This can be achieved by dividing the venue into sectors. The cantons may see fit to apply a lower number. Large-scale events for more than 1000 people will be permitted from the beginning of September, as long as there is no deterioration in the epidemiological situation. Those attending will also have to be placed in sectors.As of 22 June, there will no longer be a requirement for customers at restaurants to be seated. The Federal Council is also lifting the fixed closing time for restaurants, discos and nightclubs. Simplified basic rules for allFollowing the steps to ease measures, the Federal Council is relying even more heavily on the public to behave responsibly; people should continue to follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. The Federal Council has also simplified and harmonised requirements for sets of precautionary measures. All publicly accessible venues must have a set of precautionary measures in place. There are to be no special rules for individual categories of establishments, events or educational institutions. The same requirements will apply for all sets of precautionary measures; there are to be no more model sets of precautionary measures. In view of the low number of cases, the Federal Council is reducing the minimum distance that should be kept between two people from 2 metres to 1.5 metres. There is a significant risk of infection if individuals spend longer than 15 minutes at a distance of under 1.5 metres. If masks are worn or partitions are in place, the distance may be further reduced. At events with fixed seating, such as at concerts or in cinemas, it is sufficient to leave a free space. If it is not possible to implement distancing measures at an event or in schools, attendance lists must be kept so that contacts can be traced in the event that someone tests positive for coronavirus.

Coronavirus: Workers from third countries to be permitted to enter Switzerland again,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79580.html,2020-06-24,"Bern, 24.06.2020 - Since 11 May various steps have been taken to relax restrictions on entry to Switzerland. In a further move, on 6 July the Federal Council will lift all corona-related restrictions on the admission of workers from third countries – i.e. non-EU or EFTA states. From 6 July, the cantons will also begin to process residence applications from third-country citizens who are not planning to work in Switzerland, such as people who have retired; the normal criteria will once again apply. However, third-country citizens are still not permitted to travel to Switzerland on holiday: entry for a stay of less than 90 days that does not normally require a permit will only be authorised in cases of special necessity. Entry restrictions at the borders with all Schengen states  were lifted on 15 June 2020. Since then the internal borders between  Switzerland and the other Schengen states have been reopened and no  controls are carried out. In addition, free movement of persons with all  EU/EFTA states and the United Kingdom was fully reintroduced on 15  June.                                                 Admission to work in the tourism or culture sectors again possible                       In view of the latest developments in the pandemic, in its  next step the Federal Council plans to lift restrictions on the  admission of workers from third countries on 6 July, i.e. the usual  quota system will apply from this date. This means, for example, that it  will again be possible to come to Switzerland to work in the tourism or  culture sectors, or to take education or training courses while  working, e.g. as an au-pair, agricultural trainee or on a youth exchange  programme. Also on 6 July, restrictions will be lifted on stays of longer than  90 days for third-country citizens who are not in employment, such as  pensioners. From this date, the cantons will again begin to process  applications from these persons in accordance with the normal provisions  on the admission of foreign nationals. Depending on how the pandemic develops in individual third countries,  it is still possible that health-related measures may be introduced at  the borders under the Epidemics Act for any persons entering Switzerland  from these states.                                                Full relaxation in line with the other Schengen states                       Restrictions on entry continue to apply for third-country  citizens who wish to come to Switzerland for a short stay of less than  90 days, e.g. for a holiday, for a short course, for medical treatment  or for non-urgent business meetings. As is currently the case, such  trips will only be permitted in cases of special necessity. If possible,  Switzerland plans to lift these final entry restrictions at the same  time as the other Schengen states. A gradual and coordinated approach to  lifting the ban on entry is planned, in line with developments in the  epidemiological situation in these third countries; for some states,  restrictions may be lifted before 6 July. The EU Commission will  regularly update a list of third countries to facilitate coordination.  In consultation with the FDHA and the FDFA, the FDJP will adapt the  entry regulations for Switzerland step by step. Entry restrictions at the borders with all Schengen states  were lifted on 15 June 2020.

"Coronavirus: Federal government to assume test costs, SwissCovid app to start on 25 June",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79584.html,2020-06-24,"Bern, 24.06.2020 - In order to be able to respond rapidly to a renewed increase in the number of cases, testing should be conducted as widely as is possible and appropriate. As of 25 June, the federal government will therefore be assuming the cost of all coronavirus tests. That was the decision taken by the Federal Council at its meeting on 24 June. It also adopted the Ordinance on the Proximity Tracing System for the Coronavirus. This will make it possible to for the SwissCovid app to be used across Switzerland from 25 June. In view of the continuing low number of coronavirus cases, the Federal Council downgraded the situation from ‘extraordinary' on 19 June and eased further measures. In order to prevent a renewed increase in infections and to be able to respond rapidly to an increase in the number of cases, it is necessary to monitor the situation closely. The most important factors in breaking chains of infection are rigorous contact tracing in conjunction with widespread testing for SARS-Coronavirus-2. No retention fee for those testedAs of 25 June, the federal government will assume the costs for tests, thereby simplifying the system. To date, the costs of coronavirus tests have been split between health insurers and the cantons. This has meant that not all patients have been treated equally. In cases where the costs were covered by compulsory health insurance, the deductible and the retention fee applied for those tested. However, where testing was covered by the cantons, those tested bore no costs. As such, there was a risk that people would be reluctant to get themselves tested if they had to bear the costs themselves. The Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force also recommends that the costs for tests be assumed by the federal government.The federal government will assume the cost of tests for infection with the coronavirus and antibody tests. It will reimburse the cost of tests for SARS-Coronavirus-2 at a flat rate of 169 francs, and of antibody tests at a rate of 113 francs. The testing criteria of the Federal Office of Public Health apply. Antibody tests are not recommended at the present time.Launch of SwissCovid appThe Federal Council also adopted the Ordinance on the Proximity Tracing System, thereby making it possible to start using the SwissCovid app. The Federal Council recommends that the public use the app, which complements classic contact tracing. Contact tracing involves identifying people who have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus so that they can go into quarantine, thereby breaking chains of infection. The SwissCovid app notifies people who have spent a certain time in close proximity to a person infected with the coronavirus, provided the app is installed and active on both persons' phones. In order to receive the notification, a person who has tested positive for the virus must enter a ‘covidcode' provided by the cantonal medical service into the app. Use of the app and entering the code are both voluntary.If an app user has been in close contact with one or more infected individuals, they receive a message telling them that they may be infected with the new coronavirus. They are also notified of the day on which the contact took place along with details of the FOPH Infoline that they can call free of charge to obtain advice.Anyone instructed by a doctor or the authorities to go into quarantine is entitled to compensation for loss of earnings related to the coronapandemic. Anyone who decides voluntarily to go into quarantine after they have been notified by the SwissCovid app that they may be infected, without being required to do so by a public authority or a doctor, will not receive this compensation.Tests did not reveal any serious problemsThe app was subjected to rigorous testing for security and usability ahead of its launch. The National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) has been receiving reports on security issues from specialists and interested parties since 28 May. The test results and feedback have been made available on the NCSC website and are updated daily. In total 81 reports have been filed, 11 of which related to the program code. No critical or system-relevant problems came to light. The NCSC will continue to accept reports of test results following the public launch of the SwissCovidapp so that data protection and the security of the app can be assured.

Coronavirus: Emergency ordinance on COVID-19 credits to be incorporated into ordinary law,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79683.html,2020-07-01,"Bern, 01.07.2020 - During its meeting on 1 July 2020, the Federal Council initiated the consultation on the new Federal Act on COVID-19 Credits with Joint and Several Guarantee. This aims to incorporate the COVID-19 Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance into ordinary law. This is necessary because the Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance was issued as an emergency ordinance and is therefore valid only until 25 September 2020. The bill does not affect the ongoing granting of credits. Applications for guaranteed COVID-19 credits can be submitted until 31 July 2020. The new law regulates all important aspects over the lifetime of the credits. It also contains instruments to combat abuse and deal with cases of hardship. On 25 March 2020, the Federal Council adopted the COVID-19 Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance to provide Swiss companies with liquidity. Since then, SMEs have had quick and unbureaucratic access to bank credit facilities guaranteed by the four recognised guarantee organisations. In turn, the Confederation has given a commitment to reimburse the organisations for losses incurred from these guarantees. On 19 June, approximately 128,000 credits with an estimated volume of around CHF 15 billion had been guaranteed; over 80% of these were granted to small businesses with fewer than ten full-time staff members.The Federal Council must present the bill to incorporate the emergency ordinance into ordinary law to Parliament within six months. For the guaranteed COVID-19 credits, given the ramifications, this is to be achieved by means of a separate law. By contrast, for the remaining emergency ordinances, a common blanket framework is planned. The bill regulates the rights and obligations of the four recognised guarantee organisations, in particular in cases where the banks or PostFinance AG draw on the guarantee and the credit claims thus pass to the guarantee organisation. At the same time, it responds to demands from Parliament.The bill makes provision for various instruments to avoid cases of hardship: for example, rather than extending the existing five-year repayment period by two years, it should be possible to extend it by another five, to a maximum total of ten years. Moreover, a guaranteed credit of up to CHF 500,000 will now not be regarded as debt for the whole term of the credit, in order to avoid over-indebtedness in accordance with the Code of Obligations. In addition, the guarantee organisations will have various instruments to avoid individual cases of hardship (in particular subordination and involvement in restructuring).However, the Federal Council wants to refrain from a general debt write-off for entire economic sectors or industries. Such a solution would be unfair because it would benefit only those companies which applied for bridging credit facilities. Furthermore, it would provide powerful false incentives. The planned repayment periods will mean that, to repay a COVID-19 credit not exceeding one-tenth of annual turnover, a company will have to deploy only 1% to 2% of its turnover; this should be affordable for companies whose finances are fundamentally sound.Combating abuse even after credits have been grantedThe bill will also establish a longer-term framework for combating abuse. Initial assessments indicate very little abuse in credit applications. Nonetheless, it is planned to identify and investigate abuse in a targeted way even after a credit has been granted. Because borrowers' tax and bank data can continue to be exchanged, compliance with the rules on the use of the credit, for example the prohibition on dividend payments, can be verified.The procedure for setting the interest rate, however, should remain materially unchanged: the Federal Council will adjust the interest rate annually according to market developments. The participating banks will be consulted beforehand. Yet, while the Swiss economy remains in a recessionary phase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be assumed that the interest rate environment will not undergo any major change, and that, consequently, no interest rate adjustment will be necessary.The Federal Council proposes that Parliament debate the bill in a special procedure during the winter session; moreover, both chambers should vote on the bill in the same session. At the same time as it adopts the dispatch, the Federal Council can extend the duration of the emergency ordinance until the new legal framework enters into force, thus avoiding a regulatory gap. Owing to the legally prescribed urgency, the consultation period will run for only three weeks.

Coronavirus: Federal Council releases guarantee for SR Technics,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79695.html,2020-07-01,"Bern, 01.07.2020 - During its meeting on 1 July 2020, the Federal Council released the first phase of the guarantee credit for aviation-related businesses. It granted SR Technics Switzerland AG a deficiency guarantee of 60% on a bank loan of CHF 120 million in order to bridge a liquidity shortage. The Federal Council believes that SR Technics provides essential services to airlines which could not be supplied from elsewhere in the short term. The guarantee is subject to strict conditions and the risk borne by the Confederation is compensated in line with market rates. The entire aviation industry has been severely affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a gradual recovery, the number of flights is still low. As aviation is an economically critical infrastructure, the Federal Council decided on 8 April 2020 to take measures to ensure that Switzerland remains connected to the international air transport system. During its special session, Parliament approved guarantee and budgetary credits worth over CHF 600 million each to support aviation-related businesses, as well as an amendment to the Civil Aviation Act. Line maintenance is vital for operation During its meeting on 1 July 2020, the Federal Council released the first phase of the guarantee credit to support aviation-related businesses worth CHF 79.2 million (72 mn plus interest and fees). This will provide SR Technics Switzerland AG (SRT) with temporary liquidity. SRT operates internationally as a provider of technical maintenance services for aircraft, components and engines, and has its headquarters in Kloten. It provides critical line maintenance, which ensures that Switzerland's airports continue to operate in an orderly manner. Subsidiary involvement The Confederation will only act in a subsidiary capacity. SRT has implemented various cost-cutting measures, while its shareholders are contributing to meeting the liquidity needs as far as possible. A consortium of banks has granted an additional loan for the remaining CHF 120 million needed, of which 60% is covered by a deficiency guarantee provided by the Confederation. This guarantee represents CHF 72 million (plus interest and fees). The banks are responsible for the remaining 40% of the credit risk. The Confederation will see an outflow of funds only if the deficiency guarantee is utilised. Both the Confederation and the banks will be compensated for their involvement in line with market rates. It is intended that SRT will repay the additional loan within three and a half years. The agreements ensure compliance also with the other conditions laid down by the Federal Council in its decision of 8 April 2020. Specifically, the pledging of shares provides adequate collateral. Furthermore, the funds guaranteed by the Confederation may be used solely to maintain Swiss services, and no funds, in particular dividends, may be distributed to shareholders abroad until the additional loan has been repaid in full. Finally, conditions relating to location and employment law have been defined. According to the Competition Commission (COMCO), the aid is not compatible with the air service agreement. The Federal Council has noted this position, but wishes to maintain the support. The Federal Council believes that it is not possible to substitute SRT's line maintenance in the short term, in particular due to the stringent regulatory requirements. Rapid action is required due to the necessary liquidity. SRT's failure would place an additional burden on flight operations during this challenging period of flight resumption.

"Coronavirus: Masks compulsory on public transport; quarantine for travellers from high-risk regions; lifting of certain entry restrictions from 20 July
           (last modification, the 22.07.2020)",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79711.html,2020-07-01,"(Last modification 22.07.2020) Bern, 01.07.2020 - At its meeting on 1 July, the Federal Council took decisions on various measures to prevent the renewed spread of the coronavirus. In view of the increasing volume of people travelling and the rising number of new infections since mid-June, it has decided to make masks compulsory on public transport throughout the country from Monday, 6 July. In addition, travellers from certain regions will have to go into quarantine. Entry restrictions are expected to be lifted for an initial group of third countries from 20 July. More people are travelling on public transport since the Federal Council largely lifted measures to fight the coronavirus epidemic. As a result, it is often not possible to respect the recommended distance. In view of the increasing volume of people travelling, and the rising number of new infections since mid-June, the Federal Council is reinforcing its protective measures and has subsequently taken a fundamental decision to make the wearing of masks compulsory in all forms of public transport nationwide. From Monday, 6 July, persons over the age of 12 will have to wear a mask in trains, trams and buses, as well as on mountain rail and cableways and on lake and river boats. The amended ordinance will be adopted and published tomorrow. An urgent recommendation is already in place to wear a mask when travelling on public transport at peak times. However, few people are heeding this advice. Today’s decision by the Federal Council also comes in response to expert recommendations and at the request of certain cantons. The World health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommend that masks be worn if it is not possible to respect the necessary distance.  Quarantine for travellers from certain areasSince mid-June, the number of new cases of coronavirus has been rising in Switzerland as infected persons have entered the country from countries within the Schengen area and from non-Schengen countries. Consequently, with effect from Monday, 6 July, travellers entering Switzerland from certain regions will have to go into quarantine for ten days. The FOPH has a list of the countries concerned, which it updates regularly. Travellers affected will be notified during the flight, on board coaches and at border crossings. They will have to register with the cantonal authorities on arrival. The new ordinance will be adopted and published tomorrow. Airlines and travel companies will also be instructed not to transport sick passengers.  Entry restrictions to remain in place until 20 JulyAt its meeting on 1 July 2020, the Federal Council took note of the EU Council recommendations on lifting the entry restrictions that will apply to 15 specific countries from 1 July. Switzerland is expected to follow these recommendations, but from 20 July and with the exception of Serbia. On 20 July, the Federal Department of Justice and Police FDJP intends to remove Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay and the EU states outside the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Ireland, Croatia, Romania and Cyprus) from the list of high-risk countries. China is also expected to be removed from the list in line with the EU recommendations, provided it guarantees reciprocal rights of entry to people travelling from Switzerland. More people are travelling on public transport since the Federal Council largely lifted measures to fight the coronavirus epidemic. As a result, it is often not possible to respect the recommended distance. In view of the increasing volume of people travelling, and the rising number of new infections since mid-June, the Federal Council is reinforcing its protective measures and has subsequently taken a fundamental decision to make the wearing of masks compulsory in all forms of public transport nationwide. From Monday, 6 July, persons over the age of 12 will have to wear a mask in trains, trams and buses, as well as on mountain rail and cableways and on lake and river boats. The amended ordinance will be adopted and published tomorrow. An urgent recommendation is already in place to wear a mask when travelling on public transport at peak times. However, few people are heeding this advice. Today’s decision by the Federal Council also comes in response to expert recommendations and at the request of certain cantons. The World health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommend that masks be worn if it is not possible to respect the necessary distance.

Coronavirus: Federal Council adopts second extraordinary addendum to 2020 budget,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-80051.html,2020-08-12,"Bern, 12.08.2020 - During its meeting on 12 August 2020, the Federal Council adopted Addendum IIb to the budget for 2020 via special dispatch. It submitted 13 supplementary credits for around CHF 770 million, aimed at cushioning the further impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bulk of the funds (476.4 mn) will be applied for as extraordinary payment requirements. The measures taken to date by the Confederation to combat the COVID-19 pandemic amount to CHF 31 billion in expenditure during 2020 (supplementary credits), plus CHF 42 billion in sureties and guarantees (guarantee credits). These credits were approved by Parliament in the first half of 2020.In the meantime, it has become clear that further measures are needed in some areas. Therefore, in this Addendum IIb, adopted during the meeting on 12 August 2020, the Federal Council is applying for an additional 13 supplementary credits amounting to CHF 769.9 million.Assumption of costs for COVID-19 testsThe bulk of the Addendum relates to costs for COVID-19 tests. In order to be able to react swiftly to a renewed rise in cases, as many tests as possible and appropriate should be carried out. The Confederation is therefore assuming all costs for COVID-19 tests as of 25 June 2020. This will require a supplementary credit of CHF 288.5 million. The amount will be offset against the already approved credit for the procurement of medical materials.Other large supplementary credits involve the deposit in the railway infrastructure fund (221.3 mn) and the financial stabilization of Skyguide (150 mn). To support public transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is planned to suspend the repayment of the advance to the railway infrastructure fund in 2020. In addition, the legal maximum of two thirds of net revenue from the performance-related heavy vehicle charge is to be paid into the fund. This is why the supplementary credit is necessary. Owing to the collapse in air traffic as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Skyguide has suffered substantial revenue losses. The supplementary credit is to be used to offset this.All the supplementary credits to be voted on are aimed at cushioning the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The application for the bulk of the credits will therefore be submitted as extraordinary payment requirements, which means that their approval by Parliament requires a qualified majority (agreement of a majority of the members of both chambers).An exception clause to the debt brake provides for the possibility of designating certain expenditure as ""extraordinary"". This rule is applicable because the COVID-19 pandemic is an ""extraordinary situation"" outside the Confederation's control.What are supplementary credits?Supplementary credits are add-ons to the budget for the current year; they are to cover unavoidable expenses or investment expenditure, and require parliamentary approval. Applications for supplementary credits can be submitted if it was not possible to foresee the need for funds earlier, if delayed payment would result in considerable disadvantages and if it is not possible to wait until the next budget. The administrative units must provide full justification for their additional credit needs.The Federal Council usually submits supplementary credit applications to Parliament twice a year in a dispatch. Owing to the extraordinary situation, it is likely that a total of four supplementary credits will be needed this year; they will be debated in the next parliamentary session following their submission.

Coronavirus: Large-scale events to be permitted from October under strict conditions and with a permit,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-80054.html,2020-08-12,"Bern, 12.08.2020 - At its meeting on 12 August, the Federal Council took the decision to re-allow events for more than 1000 people from 1 October. Strict protective measures will apply and the events will have to be authorised by the cantons, taking into account the local epidemiological situation and their contact tracing capacity. The Federal Council thereby intends to ensure that the epidemiological situation in Switzerland does not deteriorate. At the same time, this careful reopening step takes into account the needs of society and the economic interests of sports clubs and cultural venues. The Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA was given the task of working with the relevant departments and the cantons to draw up standardised requirements for granting permits for large-scale events by 2 September. These should apply across the board, such as for sporting, cultural and religious events. In addition to applying basic measures such as hygiene and social distancing rules, further guidelines will also be issued, drawing on the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Science Task Force. Such events will require a permit from the relevant canton. The cantonal authorities may refuse to grant a permit if the local epidemiological situation or their contact tracing capacities do not allow it. Events for more than 1000 people have not been permitted in Switzerland since 28 February. The ban is one of the key measures that has helped to reduce the number of coronavirus infections in Switzerland. The measure applies until 31 August and will now be extended by a month until the end of September. This gives the cantons time to prepare the permit system and increase their contact tracing capacities, if necessary.By taking this approach, the Federal Council wants to ensure that the epidemiological situation does not further deteriorate. At the same time, it is taking into account society’s need for a varied programme of cultural and sporting events, as well as economic interests. Not all large-scale events pose the same level of risk. There are large-scale events at which the minimum distance between people can largely be respected.    Wearing of masks compulsory during flights The Federal Council has also decided that masks will have to be worn during flights from 15 August. The wearing of masks on public transport has been compulsory since 6 July. The measure concerns all scheduled and charter flights taking off from or landing in Switzerland, regardless of airline. Diplomats exempt from quarantine Foreign diplomats will be eligible for an exemption from the quarantine requirement if their presence in Switzerland is necessary for the proper operation of their embassies. Swiss diplomats will now also be exempt from the requirement to go into quarantine when returning from official business trips. One-off expenditures related to managing the COVID-19 pandemic Efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic have led to various additional expenses for the Federal Office of Public Health this year, such as for public awareness campaigns, running phone hotlines and developing the SwissCovid app. The Federal Council is therefore requesting a supplementary credit (from Parliament) of CHF 31.6 million for 2020 to cover the cost of managing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coronavirus: No quarantine for persons entering from border regions,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-80387.html,2020-09-11,"Bern, 11.09.2020 - At its meeting on 11 September, the Federal Council decided on the quarantine rules for persons entering Switzerland from neighbouring countries: only those regions of neighbouring countries where the infection rate is over the limit will be added to the list of countries and areas with an increased rate of infection, not the entire country. Border regions may be exempted from inclusion on the list. In so doing, the Federal Council is responding to the rapid rise in infection numbers, while still taking account of the close interaction between Switzerland and neighbouring regions. The revised ordinance will come into force on 14 September. At the same time, the list of risk areas will be updated. Since 6 July, anyone entering Switzerland from a country or area with a high risk of infection has been required to go into quarantine for ten days. This Federal Council measure aims to prevent the import of the coronavirus into Switzerland and its spread within the country as far as possible. The Federal Council is now taking a region-based approach to neighbouring countries. Only specific regions of neighbouring countries will be included in the list of countries and areas with an increased risk of infection, in line with the practice in various other countries. Exemptions for border regionsThe border regions of neighbouring countries may be exempted from inclusion on the list. By allowing this exception, the Federal Council is taking account of the close economic, social and cultural exchanges that take place in the border regions. At the same time, the Federal Council is responding to the increasing numbers of infections in Switzerland and in various neighbouring countries, particularly in France. Since June, the number of new infections in Switzerland has been rising steadily. While 98 cases were reported in the first week of June, at the end of August the figure was 1844, i.e. 18-times higher. In France, the number of cases is increasing even more rapidly and the number of new infections over two weeks in almost all regions of France is considerably higher than the limit value of 60 per 100,000 persons (14-day incidence). In certain Austrian states, a rise in cases in excess of the threshold has also been recorded, as it has in several Swiss cantons.Taking a regional approach means that persons returning to Switzerland from risk areas will be required to go into quarantine, but not persons returning from regions on the Swiss border. In implementing this measure, the Federal Council is continuing to rely on members of the public to act responsibly. They should avoid travelling to risk areas if at all possible, or spend time in quarantine if they have travelled to these regions. Cross-border commuters are already exempted from the quarantine requirement.The majority of cantons have expressed their support for this approach. However, some cantons are concerned that the new exemptions for the border regions will lead to increased costs and may lead to lower levels of compliance with the quarantine rules.Exemptions from the quarantine requirementUnder the new rules, creative artists returning from a cultural event, athletes returning from competitions and persons who have been attending professional conferences will be exempted from the quarantine requirement. However, this exemption only applies if precautionary measures have been planned and taken at the foreign event concerned.Also exempted from the quarantine requirement are persons who are required to travel without delay to a risk area for professional or medical reasons. The persons concerned must not remain abroad for more than five days, and precautionary measures must be planned and taken. In addition, the Federal Council has revised the calculation rules for quarantine in the COVID-19 Ordinance on International Passenger Transport Measures. This will allow the cantons to take account of time spent in a country where there is not a high risk of infection before entering Switzerland, and to reduce the length of time spent in quarantine in Switzerland accordingly. Coronavirus tests: Federal government reduces tariffsAt its meeting, the Federal Council also decided to reduce the tariff for a molecular-biological analysis for Sars-CoV-2 (PCR test) from CHF 95 to CHF 82 and that for a serological analysis (antibody test) from CHF 39 to CHF 25. It has also specified the details of various procedures.

Coronavirus: Federal Council adopts dispatch on new Joint and Several Guarantee Act,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-80449.html,2020-09-18,"Bern, 18.09.2020 - During its meeting on 18 September 2020, the Federal Council adopted the dispatch on the new COVID 19 Joint and Several Guarantee Act. This aims to incorporate the COVID 19 Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance into ordinary law. The Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance is an emergency ordinance that applies only until 25 September 2020. However, as it will take many more years for the credits to be repaid, a federal law is needed for dealing with the credits and sureties. The participants in the consultation viewed the proposal in a positive light. The Federal Council adopted the COVID 19 Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance on 25 March 2020 to provide Swiss companies with liquidity. This gave SMEs quick and unbureaucratic access to bank credit facilities guaranteed by the four recognised guarantee organisations. In turn, the Confederation undertook to reimburse the organisations for losses incurred on these guarantees. At the end of August, approximately 136,000 credits with a volume of around CHF 16.4 billion had been guaranteed; over 80% of these were granted to small businesses with fewer than ten full time employees.The Federal Council must present the bill to incorporate an emergency ordinance into ordinary law to Parliament within six months from the date of the ordinance's entry into force. The bill regulates the rights and obligations of the four recognised guarantee organisations, in particular in cases where the banks or PostFinance AG draw on the guarantee and the credit claims thus pass to the guarantee organisations. At the same time, it responds to demands from Parliament. The new act regulates all important aspects over the lifetime of the credits and sureties. It also contains instruments to combat abuse and deal with cases of hardship.High degree of approval in the consultationVirtually all of the participants in the consultation expressed their support for the COVID 19 Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance and its transposition into the new act. They were particularly in favour of the absence of the partial investment ban, case by case analysis for cases of hardship and the possibility of extending the repayment period from five years to a maximum of ten years. The decision to dispense with the conversion of COVID 19 credits into non repayable contributions was also clearly welcomed.Only in a few cases was an extension of the ordinary repayment period requested, even in the absence of hardship. An easing of the dividend ban was also proposed. Some consultation participants additionally called for an extension of the deadline for submitting credit applications. The Federal Council rejected these amendment proposals. It explains why in the dispatch (section 2). As a result of the clear outcome of the consultation, the text of the act largely corresponds to the consultation draft.The Federal Council proposes that Parliament debate the bill in a special procedure during the winter session. Exceptionally, both chambers should vote on the bill in the same session. This would make it possible for the act to enter into force on 1 January 2021.At the same time as adopting the dispatch, the Federal Council extended the duration of the COVID 19 Joint and Several Guarantee Ordinance, thereby preventing a regulatory gap until the new legal framework enters into force.

"Coronavirus: Restrictions on private events, no gatherings in public of more than 15 people; masks mandatory in more areas and working from home recommended",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-80771.html,2020-10-18,"Bern, 18.10.2020 - At an extraordinary meeting on 18 October, the Federal Council introduced several further national measures to combat the rapid rise in coronavirus infections. From Monday, 19 October spontaneous gatherings of more than 15 persons are not permitted in public. A mask must be worn in publicly accessible indoor areas, including in all railway stations and airports, and at bus and tram stops. Moreover, there are now new rules for private events of more than 15 persons, and in restaurants, bars and clubs food and drink may only be consumed sitting down. Following consultations with the cantons, the Federal Council has adapted the Special Situation COVID-19 Ordinance accordingly. This now also includes a recommendation to work from home. The rapid rise in coronavirus cases in the last few days is a cause for great concern. The number of cases is on the increase in all age groups and across all cantons. The number of persons admitted to hospital is also rising. The new national measures agreed by the federal government and the cantons aim to better protect the public’s health and to prevent the health system from becoming overwhelmed in the coming weeks and months. The intention is also to considerably curb the number of new cases so that the cantons can continue to contract trace effectively. Despite the restrictions, it is hoped that the economy can continue to function and people can live their lives with as little disruption as possible. Masks now mandatory in the whole of Switzerland The requirement for persons over the age of 12 to wear a mask on public transport has been in place since 6 July. From Monday 19 October this will be extended to railway stations including platforms, airports and other publicly accessible public transport areas. As before, persons who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons are exempt from the requirement. Masks are now also compulsory in publicly accessible indoor spaces including all shops, shopping centres, banks, post offices, museums, libraries, cinemas, theatres, concert venues, indoor areas of zoos and botanical gardens, restaurants, bars, discos, casinos, hotels (with the exception of guests’ rooms), entrance areas and changing rooms in swimming pools, sports facilities and gyms, doctor’s surgeries, hospitals and places of worship, advisory centres and neighbourhood centres. Masks must also be worn in publicly accessible areas of administrative buildings.  Face masks must also be worn in all schools and higher education establishments, in child-care facilities and in the training areas of sport and fitness centres if part of the centre’s precautionary measures. Rules for private events Many people become infected with the coronavirus when families and friends gather. Gatherings should be avoided were possible. At private events attended by over 15 people, food and drink may only be consumed while seated. Anyone standing up must wear a mask. Furthermore, hygiene rules must be observed at all times and contact details must be recorded. For private events of more than 100 people there must be a set of precautionary measures (as for public events) and may only be held in publicly accessible venues. Gatherings of more than 15 not permitted in public   Spontaneous gatherings of more than 15 persons are not permitted in public spaces such as town squares, streets, paths and parks. The aim is to prevent private events moving outdoors. Organised outdoor events such as political and civil society demonstrations are permitted provided precautionary measures are observed.  Seating requirement in bars, clubs and restaurants In restaurants, bars and clubs, food and drink may only be consumed while seated, both indoors and out.Working from home recommended The Federal Council has added a paragraph on working from home to the Special Situation COVID-19 Ordinance. Employers are now required to observe the recommendation by the Federal Office of Public Health for employees to work from home. This will prevent large numbers of people coming together, particularly at peak times, and reduce close contact in the workplace. It will also reduce the risk of a whole work team having to go into quarantine if one member becomes infected with COVID-19. Since 19 June, the cantons have played the lead role in combating the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. The Confederation still expects the cantons to conduct widespread testing, implement a sound system of contract tracing and employ targeted measures to help fight the epidemic. The rapid rise in coronavirus cases in the last few days is a cause for great concern. The number of cases is on the increase in all age groups and across all cantons. The number of persons admitted to hospital is also rising. The new national measures agreed by the federal government and the cantons aim to better protect the public’s health and to prevent the health system from becoming overwhelmed in the coming weeks and months. The intention is also to considerably curb the number of new cases so that the cantons can continue to contract trace effectively.

Masks are now also compulsory in publicly accessible indoor spaces including all shops, shopping centres, banks, post offices, museums, libraries, cinemas, theatres, concert venues, indoor areas of zoos and botanical gardens, restaurants, bars, discos, casinos, hotels (with the exception of guests’ rooms), entrance areas and changing rooms in swimming pools, sports facilities and gyms, doctor’s surgeries, hospitals and places of worship, advisory centres and neighbourhood centres.

At private events attended by over 15 people, food and drink may only be consumed while seated. Anyone standing up must wear a mask. Furthermore, hygiene rules must be observed at all times and contact details must be recorded. For private events of more than 100 people there must be a set of precautionary measures (as for public events) and may only be held in publicly accessible venues. Gatherings of more than 15 not permitted in public Spontaneous gatherings of more than 15 persons are not permitted in public spaces such as town squares, streets, paths and parks. The aim is to prevent private events moving outdoors. Organised outdoor events such as political and civil society demonstrations are permitted provided precautionary measures are observed. Seating requirement in bars, clubs and restaurants In restaurants, bars and clubs, food and drink may only be consumed while seated, both indoors and out. Working from home recommended The Federal Council has added a paragraph on working from home to the Special Situation COVID-19 Ordinance. Employers are now required to observe the recommendation by the Federal Office of Public Health for employees to work from home. This will prevent large numbers of people coming together, particularly at peak times, and reduce close contact in the workplace. It will also reduce the risk of a whole work team having to go into quarantine if one member becomes infected with COVID-19. Since 19 June, the cantons have played the lead role in combating the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. The Confederation still expects the cantons to conduct widespread testing, implement a sound system of contract tracing and employ targeted measures to help fight the epidemic."
"Coronavirus: further measures to contain the epidemic, introduction of rapid testing, new rules on travel quarantine",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-80882.html,2020-10-28,"Bern, 28.10.2020 - At its meeting on 28 October, the Federal Council agreed a further series of national measures to combat the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The aim of the measures is to sharply reduce the level of contact between people. Discos and nightclubs will have to shut, while bars and restaurants will close at 11pm. All events with more than 50 people, and recreational sporting and cultural activities with more than 15 people, will be prohibited. Furthermore, the requirement to wear masks will be extended to an additional range of situations. The measures will apply from Thursday, 29 October, for an indefinite period of time. From Monday, 2 November, higher education institutions will have to forgo face-to-face teaching. Following consultations with the cantons, the Federal Council has amended the Special Situation Covid-19 Ordinance accordingly. It has also amended the rules regarding travel quarantine, and approved the introduction of rapid testing. The number of cases of people infected with the virus and the number of people requiring hospital treatment are rising sharply. The Federal Council wants to curb the spread of the coronavirus and prevent intensive care units and healthcare staff in hospitals from becoming overburdened. It is therefore introducing measures aimed at reducing the level of contact between people.Nightclubs to close, fairs not permittedDiscos and nightclubs will be closed. There is an elevated risk of the virus spreading at these establishments. No more than four people will be allowed to sit at a table in restaurants and bars, with the exception of parents with children. All bars and restaurants must close between 11pm and 6am. In addition, markets and fairs in enclosed spaces will no longerbe permitted.Ban on events with more than 50 peopleEvents with more than 50 people will no longer be permitted. This concerns all religious, sporting, cultural and other events. The exceptions to this rule are parliamentary and communal assemblies. It is still permitted to hold political demonstrations and collect signatures for referendums and initiatives – here, as previously, masks must be worn. Given that many people are becoming infected when families and friends meet, the number of people allowed to attend such private gatherings will be limited to 10.No recreational sporting or cultural activities with more than 15 peopleRecreational sporting and cultural activities are only permitted indoors for up to 15 people if a sufficient distance can be maintained and if masks are worn. A mask can only be dispensed with if there is a generous amount of space, such as in tennis halls or large rooms. Outdoors, for example when jogging, it is only necessary to ensure that people keep their distance. Recreational contact sports are prohibited everywhere. These rules do not apply to children under the age of 16, even in compulsory schools.With regard to professional sporting and cultural activities, practice and training sessions, competitive events, rehearsals and performances are permitted. Due to the fact that a particularly large number of droplets are released while singing, all performances by amateur choirs are prohibited, although professional choirs may continue to practise.Ban on face-to-face teaching at higher education institutionsHigher education institutions will basically have to switch to distance learning from Monday, 2 November. Classroom teaching is still permitted at compulsory school level and at upper secondary schools (baccalaureate and vocational schools).Mandatory wearing of masks further extendedThe wearing of masks has been mandatory since 19 October in publicly accessible indoor spaces as well as in public transport waiting areas and railway stations and airports. Masks must now also be worn outside establishments and facilities, for example in outdoor areas of shops and at event venues, on terraces of restaurants and bars, and at farmers’ and Christmas markets. Masks are also mandatory in busy pedestrian zones, for example shopping streets in town centres, and wherever the required distance cannot be maintained in public spaces.Wearing a mask is now also mandatory in schools from upper secondary level (level II) upwards. Similarly, masks are now mandatory in the workplace unless the distance between workspaces can be maintained (e.g. in individual offices). Employers should allow staff to work from home where possible and ensure that staff are protected in the workplace.Children under the age of 12, persons who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons, and guests in restaurants and bars when seated at a table are not required to wear a mask.Federal Council to introduce rapid testing From 2 November, rapid antigen tests may also be used to determine a Covid-19 infection, in addition to the PCR tests already in use. This will allow faster and more widespread testing and enable more positive cases among the population to be identified and isolated rapidly. The accuracy of rapid tests has been evaluated by the Centre national de Référence pour Infections Virales Emergentes (CRIVE) in Geneva. The rapid tests are less sensitive than PCR tests and will mainly be used to test persons who are potentially infectious. The Federal Office of Public Health FOPH therefore only envisages using these rapid tests for certain groups of individuals who are deemed symptomatic according to the FOPH criteria, symptoms having emerged within the previous four days, and who are not classed as being at especially high risk. Rapid tests may also be used for non-symptomatic individuals who have been notified via the SwissCovid app. However, anyone who tests positive following a rapid test should go into isolation immediately.The cost of the rapid tests will be covered by the Confederation – although only for individuals who fulfil the FOPH criteria for being tested. Federal Council sets new threshold for travel quarantineThe Federal Council has also adapted the threshold for countries and areas to be added to the quarantine list, as well as exceptions to the quarantine requirement for business travellers. The changes come into force on 29 October.As incidence rates in Switzerland are now above average compared with the rest of Europe, the threshold will be raised. Under the amended provisions, only countries and areas with an incidence rate that is 60 higher than that in Switzerland will now be placed on the quarantine list. The provisions covering exceptions for business travellers and for people travelling for medical reasons are also to be amended. The rule whereby such trips must not last longer than five days will no longer apply.

In addition, for a further number of months the Confederation will assume the cost of subscriptions to the Keystone-SDA news agency invoiced to the electronic media. This was decided by the Federal Council at its meeting on 11 November 2020. Daily and weekly newspapers and electronic media with a subscription to Keystone-SDA will therefore continue to benefit from additional financial assistance.

"Coronavirus: simplified, faster generation of SwissCovid app codes",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81184.html,2020-11-18,"Berne, 18.11.2020 - The process of generating covidcodes has been significantly simplified and accelerated. Persons who have tested positive can enter their code into the SwissCovid app to inform other app users of possible exposure to the virus. Previously, only cantonal medical services as well as the attending doctor were authorised to generate covidcodes. This circle has now been expanded to include labs, infoline staff, testing centres and pharmacies. In its 18 November 2020 meeting, the Federal Council has approved the related amendments to the ordinance, which also provide the basis for a fully automated process around the covidcode. Data protection continues to be guaranteed. The isolation of persons who have tested positive and the mandated quarantine for their close contacts are both designed to break the transmission chain and are thus important measures to address the Covid-19 epidemic. They are prescribed in the framework of the so-called contact tracing. The proximity tracing system (PT system) of the SwissCovid app supports contact tracing. By entering their covidcode into the app, users with a positive test result prompt an anonymous message to all users of the app who, through contact with the person, might have been exposed to the virus. To make sure users of the SwissCovid app who have tested positive receive their covidcode as quickly as possible, a new set of persons have been given access to the code management system to generate codes. Data security continues to be a top priority and remains guaranteed.  Goal of the amendments to the ordinance The amendments of the Ordinance on the Proximity Tracing System for the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus allow for the workload of the cantonal medical officers to be shared with additional groups of persons with access to the code management system and, simultaneously, for the automated generation of codes. The main purpose of the amendments is to speed up the distribution of covidcodes, so that as little time as possible elapses between the SwissCovid app user receiving his or her positive test result and the moment a warning is sent to the other users.  Additional groups authorised to generate covidcodes  According to the amended ordinance, labs, infoline staff, testing centres and pharmacies are now also authorised to generate covidcodes. Labs being the first place to learn of a positive test result, authorising them to directly generate covidcodes will likely contribute in a meaningful way to speeding up the SwissCovid app processes and thus increase the app's effectiveness. Medical staff at testing centres administer tests and (if rapid tests are used) share the positive result with the affected person. They are now able to directly issue a covidcode to this person. The same applies to pharmacy staff who administer rapid tests. The authorisation of infoline staff to access the code management system provides further support to the cantonal medical offices. Automation of the covidcode process  In order to ensure a simpler and, importantly, quicker generation of covidcodes, it is now possible to generate them automatically and issue them directly to users of the SwissCovid app who have tested positive. This automated generation of codes is generally open to all healthcare facilities and their specialist staff who have access to the code management system. The automated generation of covidcodes requires an interface between the code management system and the system used by the healthcare facility in question.

Coronavirus: Federal Council adjusts COVID-19 support measures to second wave,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81212.html,2020-11-18,"Bern, 18.11.2020 - During its meeting on 18 November 2020, the Federal Council decided to propose that the winter session of Parliament urgently debate ad hoc adjustments to the COVID-19 Act. This would enable a swifter reaction to ongoing developments during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal includes an expansion of the hardship support programme to CHF 1 billion in total and an increase of the Confederation's share to around two thirds. In addition, short-time working compensation payments should be extended. In sport, professional and semi-professional clubs should be able to receive support in the form of non-repayable contributions. The Federal Council considers that the existing package of measures to cushion the impact of the pandemic is generally sufficient. However, it would like to use ad hoc adjustments to create the basis for better reacting to developments during the second wave. The Federal Council is therefore submitting a dispatch to Parliament on amendments to the COVID-19 Act and the COVID-19 Joint and Several Guarantee Act. In the COVID-19 Act, the provisions on cases of hardship (Art. 12), sport (Art. 13 and a new Art. 12b) and unemployment insurance (Art. 17), in particular, are to be amended:Cases of hardship: The total amount of support from the Confederation and cantons should be increased to CHF 1 billion. The Confederation's share in these costs would be 50% up to CHF 400 million (i.e. CHF 200 million) and 80% thereafter (CHF 480 million). The Confederation would thus bear around two thirds of the costs incurred, and the cantons one third. The details are regulated in the Ordinance, which is due to be approved at the forthcoming Federal Council meeting and enter into force on 1 December. In addition, the Federal Council wants to accommodate the cantons by relaxing enforcement and simplifying access to company data.Short-time working compensation: To secure jobs and avoid COVID-related redundancies, a renewed, targeted expansion of unemployment benefits should take place in the area of short-time working compensation. A number of the unemployment insurance-related measures introduced in spring under emergency law should be transferred into the COVID-19 Act. In particular, the entitlement to short-time working compensation should be extended to cover fixed-term employment relationships, and the grace period should be abolished.Sport: As a supplement to the existing stabilisation measures, professional and semi-professional clubs should be able to receive non-repayable contributions as well as loans. This should secure the core structure of Swiss performance and grassroots sport, training activities and sporting competitions. The Federal Council wants to compensate clubs for up to two thirds of their lost ticket sales revenue, based on the figures for the 2018/2019 season. In return, the clubs must meet strict requirements, specifically by permanently reducing top salaries, forgoing dividend payments, continuing to promote youth and women's sport to at least the same level as hitherto, and being completely transparent on the use of funds. Of the CHF 175 million in funds set aside for loans in 2021, it should be possible for up to CHF 115 million to take the form of non-repayable contributions. The option of granting loans continues to exist.In addition, the Federal Council has led a discussion on reactivating the COVID-19 credit programme. In spring, these credits were in the form of emergency assistance to bridge liquidity problems in the first few months of the pandemic, but the current situation is not comparable with that during the first wave. For example, major state support measures are already in place and no market failure has been observed in the granting of ordinary business loans by the banks. In the Federal Council's view, at the moment hardship assistance is therefore the best instrument for cushioning COVID-19's negative consequences rapidly and in a targeted manner. However, in order to be able to react quickly to a potential credit crunch, the Federal Council is asking Parliament for a delegation norm to create a new loan programme. This would allow the Federal Council to set up a new system of joint and several guarantees at ordinance level in the event that the situation deteriorates sharply and credit provision no longer functions correctly.Furthermore, the Federal Council is proposing an amendment to the Fixed Penalties Act within the framework of the COVID-19 Act. Minor infringements of the Epidemics Act (EpidA), e.g. violations of the obligation to wear a facemask, should likewise be punishable under the fixed penalty procedure.The Federal Council is submitting the bill to Parliament with the request to debate it urgently during the winter session.

Coronavirus: Federal Council adopts COVID-19 Hardship Assistance Ordinance,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81342.html,2020-11-25,"Bern, 25.11.2020 - During its meeting on 25 November 2020, the Federal Council adopted the ordinance governing the details of the hardship support programme of the Confederation and cantons. The draft was adjusted based on the results of the general consultation and the consultation of the Economic Affairs and Taxation Committees. Specifically, the ordinance regulates how federal funds are distributed among the cantons and the conditions under which companies are entitled to hardship assistance. The Federal Department of Finance (FDF) conducted a consultation on the COVID-19 Hardship Assistance Ordinance from 4 to 13 November 2020. Despite the short consultation period, more than 100 responses were received. The procedural concept was supported by all parties, as well as by the vast majority of the cantons and umbrella organisations. The rapid entry into force on 1 December 2020 was also welcomed. At the same time, almost all participants requested changes.  The Federal Council has made the following changes to the draft based on the feedback received:  Implementation simplifications: Some prerequisites for assistance have been deleted or adapted. In particular, the requirement for any COVID-19 credit with a joint and several guarantee to be fully utilised has been dropped. In addition, the cantons will now be able to simultaneously grant both loans and non-repayable contributions to a company (the draft did not provide for cumulation).Decline in turnover: Under the law, a potential case of hardship exists if annual turnover is less than 60% of the multi-year average. The draft ordinance provided that compensation for short-time working and COVID-19 loss of earnings compensation must be added to the 2020 turnover, as many companies were able to offset some of the lost revenue in that way. The Federal Council's ordinance leaves it to the cantons to adjust the definition of turnover.Minimum turnover: A company must have generated turnover of at least CHF 100,000 before the coronavirus pandemic in order to apply for hardship contributions. The draft had provided for a minimum of CHF 50,000. The increase is intended to prevent the cantons' scarce administrative resources from being used to process applications from microenterprises.State participations: As hitherto, companies that are partly owned by communes or cantons should be able to apply for hardship assistance only if the state participation is less than 10%. However, the ordinance now provides for an exception, in that companies which are more than 10% owned by smaller communes with up to 12,000 inhabitants (e.g. ski lifts or chairlifts owned by mountain communes) are eligible for hardship assistance.Ban on dividends/bonuses: The five-year ban on dividends or bonuses in the case of non-repayable contributions is to cease to apply upon repayment of the contribution received.Simplified composition proceedings: As an accompanying measure to support companies in distress, it should be possible to simplify composition proceedings.  The recommendations of the Economic Affairs and Taxation Committee (EATC) were taken into account. The ordinance should enter into force on 1 December 2020. The basis for this ordinance is laid down in Article 12 of the COVID-19 Act, which the Federal Council requested be amended on 18 November 2020. Parliament will deliberate on the corresponding dispatch during the winter session.

Coronavirus: Federal Council introduces further measures and urges cantons with increasing case numbers to take immediate action,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81477.html,2020-12-04,"Bern, 04.12.2020 - The epidemiological situation in Switzerland remains extremely serious. The Federal Council has therefore called on cantons in which case numbers are increasing to take immediate action. It also decided at its meeting on 4 December to introduce new measures. The aim is to bring down the number of cases further still, particularly in the run-up to the festive period. Stricter rules for shops will come into effect on Wednesday, 9 December, and capacity in closed forms of transport at ski resorts will be restricted. In certain cantons, the number of coronavirus infections is stagnating at a high level or is even rising again. The situation in hospitals is still extremely strained. Non-urgent procedures are having to be postponed at certain hospitals and hospital staff are under a great deal of pressure.The Federal Council is concerned by these developments. It has therefore urged the cantons to take immediate action and introduce stricter measures if their situation is deteriorating or stagnating at a high level. Criteria include the number of infections, the R-number, the number of hospital admissions and the incidence rate. The Federal Council is convinced that rapid action is the only way of averting the introduction of stricter measures. It will hold a special meeting on Tuesday, 8 December, in order to make an interim assessment and will decide on stricter measures on 11 December if the cantons have not taken the required action.Fewer people allowed in shopsThere is an additional risk of the virus spreading over the festive period as people do more shopping and get together with friends and family. After consulting with the cantons, the Federal Council has therefore decided to impose stricter measures and has amended the COVID-19 Ordinance accordingly.To further protect the public, the number of people allowed to be in a shop at any one time will be reduced. The restriction (space per customer in larger stores: 10m2 instead of 4m2) will come into force on 9 December and remain in place until further notice. The intention is to encourage members of the public to plan their shopping outings carefully.New rules for restaurantsIn restaurants throughout the country, contact details for at least one guest per table must be registered, as is already the case in various cantons. On New Year's Eve, closing time will be extended exceptionally from 11pm to 1am to reduce the risk of spontaneous private gatherings.Singing, whether indoors or outdoors, is not permitted, apart from in a family setting or at primary and lower secondary schools. This ban covers choirs and congregations at religious services and certain New Year celebrations involving singing.The Federal Council strongly recommends that people from no more than two households meet when holding private gatherings or visiting a restaurant to keep the number of contacts to a minimum. The 10-person limit still applies. To further reduce the number of contacts and the flow of people, the recommendations on working from home should be applied more widely. The Federal Council has therefore renewed its appeal to employers to allow staff to work from home where feasible to make it as easy as possible for them to keep contact with other people to a minimum in the run-up to the festive period. Reducing contacts is particularly sensible if people plan to see friends and family members who are at high risk.Ski areas can open if case numbers are fallingSki areas should be allowed to open for domestic tourism. Where the epidemiological situation is critical, measures must first be taken to allow it to improve. From 22 December, ski areas will require a permit from the cantonal authorities in order to operate. The prerequisite is that the epidemiological situation so allows, and that hospitals, contact tracing services and testing sites have sufficient capacity. Ski resort operators must also put in place strict precautionary measure plans that reflect the national standardised requirements. The aim is to prevent the virus from spreading in tourist destinations. Ski areas themselves are not subject to capacity restrictions. However, from 9 December only two thirds of maximum capacity will be permitted in all closed forms of transport, such as trains, gondolas and cablecars. This applies to seating and standing room.Face coverings must be worn when queuing for and travelling on all forms of transport, including drag- and chairlifts, and distance must be maintained when queuing. Guests at restaurants in ski areas will only be allowed inside the premises if there is a table available. The current rules continue to apply to indoor and outdoor areas: customers must be seated with no more than four people per table, with the exception of parents and their children.The cantons have a duty to monitor compliance. If significant problems arise, ski resort operators will be issued with a warning. If the situation is not rectified, the permit must be withdrawn. The cantons must also provide a report to the federal authorities on the number of checks carried out, the number of warnings issued and permits withdrawn, as well as on hospital capacity. In certain cantons, the number of coronavirus infections is stagnating at a high level or is even rising again. The situation in hospitals is still extremely strained. Non-urgent procedures are having to be postponed at certain hospitals and hospital staff are under a great deal of pressure. The Federal Council is concerned by these developments. It has therefore urged the cantons to take immediate action and introduce stricter measures if their situation is deteriorating or stagnating at a high level. Criteria include the number of infections, the R-number, the number of hospital admissions and the incidence rate. The Federal Council is convinced that rapid action is the only way of averting the introduction of stricter measures. It will hold a special meeting on Tuesday, 8 December, in order to make an interim assessment and will decide on stricter measures on 11 December if the cantons have not taken the required action. Fewer people allowed in shopsThere is an additional risk of the virus spreading over the festive period as people do more shopping and get together with friends and family. After consulting with the cantons, the Federal Council has therefore decided to impose stricter measures and has amended the COVID-19 Ordinance accordingly.To further protect the public, the number of people allowed to be in a shop at any one time will be reduced. The restriction (space per customer in larger stores: 10m2 instead of 4m2) will come into force on 9 December and remain in place until further notice. The intention is to encourage members of the public to plan their shopping outings carefully.New rules for restaurantsIn restaurants throughout the country, contact details for at least one guest per table must be registered, as is already the case in various cantons. On New Year's Eve, closing time will be extended exceptionally from 11pm to 1am to reduce the risk of spontaneous private gatherings. Singing, whether indoors or outdoors, is not permitted, apart from in a family setting or at primary and lower secondary schools. This ban covers choirs and congregations at religious services and certain New Year celebrations involving singing. The Federal Council strongly recommends that people from no more than two households meet when holding private gatherings or visiting a restaurant to keep the number of contacts to a minimum. The 10-person limit still applies. To further reduce the number of contacts and the flow of people, the recommendations on working from home should be applied more widely. The Federal Council has therefore renewed its appeal to employers to allow staff to work from home where feasible to make it as easy as possible for them to keep contact with other people to a minimum in the run-up to the festive period. Reducing contacts is particularly sensible if people plan to see friends and family members who are at high risk. Ski areas can open if case numbers are fallingSki areas should be allowed to open for domestic tourism. Where the epidemiological situation is critical, measures must first be taken to allow it to improve. From 22 December, ski areas will require a permit from the cantonal authorities in order to operate. The prerequisite is that the epidemiological situation so allows, and that hospitals, contact tracing services and testing sites have sufficient capacity. Ski resort operators must also put in place strict precautionary measure plans that reflect the national standardised requirements. The aim is to prevent the virus from spreading in tourist destinations. Ski areas themselves are not subject to capacity restrictions. However, from 9 December only two thirds of maximum capacity will be permitted in all closed forms of transport, such as trains, gondolas and cablecars. This applies to seating and standing room.Face coverings must be worn when queuing for and travelling on all forms of transport, including drag- and chairlifts, and distance must be maintained when queuing. Guests at restaurants in ski areas will only be allowed inside the premises if there is a table available. The current rules continue to apply to indoor and outdoor areas: customers must be seated with no more than four people per table, with the exception of parents and their children. The cantons have a duty to monitor compliance. If significant problems arise, ski resort operators will be issued with a warning. If the situation is not rectified, the permit must be withdrawn. The cantons must also provide a report to the federal authorities on the number of checks carried out, the number of warnings issued and permits withdrawn, as well as on hospital capacity."
Coronavirus: Federal Council introduces 7pm closing time and closures on Sundays and public holidays,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81582.html,2020-12-11,"Bern, 11.12.2020 - At its meeting on 11 December, the Federal Council tightened its measures to counter the spread of the coronavirus. The aim is to reduce the level of contact between people and to prevent people from gathering together. Restaurants and bars, shops and markets, museums and libraries, and sports and leisure facilities will be required to close at 7pm from tomorrow, Saturday, 12 December. With the exception of restaurants and bars they must also remain closed on Sundays and public holidays. Cantons with a more favourable epidemiological situation may extend the closing time until 11pm. Events are banned, with certain exceptions, while sports and cultural activities are still permitted in groups of up to five people. The number of cases of infection with coronavirus remains very high and in many cantons it is starting to rise again. Hospitals are nearing capacity and medical staff are under enormous pressure. The situation is of the utmost concern, not least because of the high risk of a further and more rapid rise in the number of cases in the coming days. People are spending more time indoors because of the cold weather and contacts among family and friends are set to increase over the festive season.After consulting the cantons, the Federal Council has decided to take action to reduce the number of contacts and prevent gatherings of people. The measures take effect from tomorrow, Saturday 12 December, and will remain in place until 22 January 2021.Closing time from 7pm and on Sundays and public holidaysRestaurants and bars, shops and markets, museums and libraries, and sports and leisure facilities will all have to close between 7pm and 6am. Shops, markets, museums, libraries and sports and leisure facilities will also have to remain closed on Sundays and national public holidays. Restaurants and bars, however, may open on Sundays and public holidays. On 24 December and New Year's Eve, the closing time will be 1am. Takeaways and delivery services can remain open until 11pm. Exceptions for cantons with an improved epidemiological situationThe cantons that are in a more favourable epidemiological situation will be allowed to extend the closing time up to 11pm. However, this will be dependent on the R-number remaining less than 1.0 for at least seven days and the weekly incidence remaining below the Swiss average for at least seven days. In addition, sufficient contact-tracing and healthcare capacities must be available in the canton concerned. Cantons that wish to extend opening hours must agree the move with neighbouring cantons.Ban on eventsPublic events will be banned. Exceptions are made for religious services (for up to 50 people), funerals attended by family and close friends, parliamentary assemblies and political demonstrations. Private gatherings: ‘rule of 10' continues to applyThe Federal Council has decided against further restrictions on private gatherings. The current rule of no more than ten persons will continue to apply. Children count towards this number. In addition, the Federal Council strongly recommends that private gatherings be limited to two households. This rule is clear and means that small-scale Christmas celebrations are possible. Sport and culture: groups of up to five permittedAmateur sports activities are only allowed in groups of up to five persons. Contact sports remain banned. Amateur cultural activities are also restricted to groups of up to five persons. Sports and cultural activities (with the exception of competitions) involving children up to the age of 16 are still permitted. Also permitted are training and competitions for members of a national squad, as are training sessions and matches for ice hockey and football teams in the professional leagues, but without any spectators. Rehearsals and performances by professional artists or ensembles remain permitted.Opinions of the cantons differ considerablyIn the consultations, the cantons essentially agreed with the assessment of the epidemiological situation. A majority welcomes more uniformity in the measures being applied. Many are also calling for the federal government to act directly to impose effective measures to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic. However, a large majority of the cantons does not agree with the action the Federal Council is taking.The Federal Council will discuss whether to proceed with even further-reaching restrictions at its meeting on 18 December.

Hospitals and healthcare workers have been under extreme pressure for weeks and the festive period increases the risk of an even more rapid rise in cases. At its meeting on 18 December, the Federal Council, after consulting the cantons, decided to tighten national measures against the spread of the coronavirus even further. The aim is to considerably reduce the number of contacts. From Tuesday, 22 December, restaurants and bars, cultural venues and sports and leisure facilities will have to close. The Federal Council has also expanded the use of rapid tests. The aim of the measures is to reduce case numbers rapidly and substantially, to protect people from the virus, safeguard the health service and relieve the pressure on healthcare workers.

Coronavirus: Entry ban and retroactive quarantine for persons from the UK and South Africa,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81777.html,2020-12-21,"Bern, 21.12.2020 - Following the discovery of a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus in the UK and South Africa, the Federal Council today decided to take steps to prevent the further spread of this new virus strain. All persons who have entered Switzerland from these two countries since 14 December must go into quarantine for 10 days. The Federal Council has also introduced a general entry ban from today for all foreign nationals seeking to enter Switzerland from the UK and South Africa. This is intended in particular to stop travel from these countries for tourism purposes. The Federal Council has approved amendments to COVID-19 Ordinance 3 prohibiting air travel between Switzerland and the UK and South Africa. The Federal Office of Civil Aviation FOCA yesterday ordered flights between Switzerland and these two countries to be suspended as of midnight on Sunday, 20 December. A temporary derogation from the flight ban is being considered for persons resident in the UK or South Africa currently staying in Switzerland so that they may return home. That is also the case for persons resident in Switzerland currently staying in those two countries. However, it is imperative that such return journeys do not lead to infections.The Federal Council also decided to withdraw freedom of movement privileges from persons resident in the UK until 31 December. Persons from the UK are therefore subject to a general ban on entering Switzerland. Freedom of movement privileges for British citizens were due to expire at the end of the year anyway.The UK and South African authorities were given prior notice of the measures.Initial indications are that the new variant of the coronavirus is significantly more transmissible than the existing strain. It is not yet clear to what extent the new strain has spread outside the UK and South Africa. No cases of the new strain have so far been identified in Switzerland.

Coronavirus: Federal Council extends and tightens measures,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81967.html,2021-01-13,"Bern, 13.01.2021 - Case numbers are stagnating at a very high level and there is a risk that the new more infectious variants of the virus will lead to another rapid rise in cases. In view of the worrying epidemiological situation, the Federal Council decided at its meeting on 13 January to introduce further measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. It is extending the measures introduced in December by a further five weeks: restaurants, cultural venues, and sports and leisure facilities are to remain closed until the end of February. It is also introducing new measures to drastically reduce contact between people. From Monday, 18 January, there will be a requirement to work from home, shops selling non-essential goods will be closed, stricter rules will apply to private events and gatherings, and measures to protect those at especially high risk will be strengthened in the workplace. On 11 and 18 December 2020, the Federal Council tightened national measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. As of 22 December, restaurants, leisure and sports facilities, and cultural venues were required to close. Despite these additional restrictions, there has been no significant fall in case numbers. The epidemiological situation remains extremely concerning: the number of infections, hospital admissions and deaths remains extremely high and the strain on medical staff is acute.New, highly transmissible virus variants: fresh increase likelyFurthermore, Switzerland is faced with two new, highly transmissible variants of the virus. These increase the risk of a further rise in the number of cases, which is likely to be difficult to control. In recent weeks, case numbers have soared in several countries in which the new variant is already circulating. There is nothing to indicate that the situation will develop any differently in Switzerland. Initial indications are that the new variants are between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible.The Federal Council is extremely concerned by these developments, even though there are no indications so far that the new variants are more dangerous or cause a more severe course of the disease. It is doing everything in its power to greatly reduce contact between people in order to slow down the spread of the new virus variants. That is why it has decided to take additional measures.Five-week extension of closuresThe Federal Council is therefore extending the measures introduced in December by a further five weeks. Restaurants, cultural venues, sports and leisure facilities will remain closed until the end of February.Closure of shops selling non-essential goodsIn addition, the Federal Council is introducing stricter national measures with effect from Monday 18 January. All shops and markets other than those selling essential everyday goods are to close. It will still be possible to collect ordered goods. Shops, service station shops and kiosks will no longer have to close at 7pm or remain closed on Sundays.Requirement to work from homeEmployers will be required to enable all staff to work from home where it is feasible and practicable for them to do so based on the type of activity. Employers will not be required to assume expenses incurred by employees for electricity or rent etc. as this is a temporary measure.Further measures at the workplaceWhere working from home is not possible or only partially so, further measures will be introduced for the workplace. Masks must be worn indoors to protect employees where there is more than one person in a room. Maintaining a large distance between workspaces in the same room is no longer sufficient.Furthermore, at the request of the Conference of Cantonal Directors of Public Health and in light of practical experiences to date, the rules regarding dispensation from the requirement to wear a mask are to be clarified. A medical certificate issued by a doctor or psychotherapist is required to affirm dispensation on medical grounds; a medical certificate may only be issued if indicated for the person concerned.Protecting people at especially high riskPeople at especially high risk will benefit from specific protection. The right to work from home, benefit from equivalent protection at the workplace or take leave of absence will be introduced. Employers of people at especially high risk in occupations in which protective measures cannot be implemented must grant those employees a leave of absence on full pay. In such cases, they may claim coronavirus-related compensation for loss of earnings.Private events and gatherings restrictedNo more than five people may attend private gatherings. Children are also included in that number. Gatherings of people in public are also limited to five people. On 11 and 18 December 2020, the Federal Council tightened national measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

Coronavirus: Federal government to cover costs of tests for persons without symptoms and modify quarantine rules,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82136.html,2021-01-27,"Bern, 27.01.2021 - At its meeting on 27 January, the Federal Council took a range of decisions to further contain and overcome the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government will now pay for persons without symptoms to be tested so that those who are particularly vulnerable can be better protected and local outbreaks of infection can be contained early on. The quarantine rules have also been modified: with a negative test result a person may now come out of quarantine after seven rather than the full ten days. The Federal Council has also decided that fines can be imposed if certain measures are not respected. Furthermore, the federal government will now cover the cost of pharmacies carrying out vaccinations. It is believed that more than half of COVID-19 infections are transmitted by people who do not display symptoms and are unaware that they actually have the virus. The federal government has therefore permitted the testing of asymptomatic persons from mid-December as a further precautionary measure, e.g. in care homes, hotels and in the workplace. It will now assume the costs in order to encourage such institutions to conduct rapid tests, and this can be done by their own staff. Negative test results do not have to be reported; if a person tests positive to a rapid test, they must undergo a PCR test and the result must be reported.By extending the testing strategy, the government hopes that local outbreaks of the virus, for example in schools, can be identified and contained at an early stage. This is particularly important in view of the fact that new, more infectious strains of the coronavirus are currently spreading in Switzerland. In such cases, the federal government will now also assume the cost of testing people who do not display symptoms. The local canton must present a test plan to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) containing details of where testing will take place, who will be tested, how often and the type of test to be used.The FOPH testing criteria are to be amended accordingly. The extended testing strategy requires an amendment to COVID-19 Ordinance 3, which enters into force tomorrow, Thursday 28th January.Quarantine rules modifiedThe current quarantine rules are to be adapted to include a test-and-release strategy. Until now anyone who has come into contact with an infected person has had to go into quarantine for ten days. Under the new rules, a person may leave quarantine after seven days if after this time they have a negative result from an antigen rapid test or a PCR test (molecular biological analysis), and are authorised to do so by the local cantonal authorities. The person must pay for the test themselves and must wear a mask and continue to socially distance until the full ten days' quarantine is over, unless they remain at home (or in the place they are quarantining - holiday apartment, hotel etc.). If their test result is positive, they must isolate immediately.Reduced travel quarantineThe new test-and-release strategy also applies to persons arriving in Switzerland from a country or region with a high risk of infection. On arrival, these travellers must present valid proof of a negative PCR test result that is no more than 72 hours old. They then have to quarantine for ten days; they can leave quarantine after seven days if they again test negative (antigen rapid test or PCR test). All persons arriving by air even from a country that is not considered high risk must be able to show a negative PCR test result before boarding the plane.Contact tracing extendedUntil now, only the contact details of people arriving in Switzerland from a high-risk country or region have been recorded. From now on, all persons arriving from abroad by air, boat, bus or train must complete an online form on arrival. With this information, cases of infection can be identified more easily and transmission chains broken more rapidly.As a result of the Federal Council's new quarantine and travel rules, amendments are required to the relevant COVID-19 ordinances. These will apply from 8 February. Fixed penalties: breaking the rules is an offence From 1 February anyone contravening the measures to fight the epidemic will be committing an offence; persons who fail to comply with the rules may be fined between 50 and 200 francs, depending on the offence. For example, anyone who does not wear a mask on public transport, in stations, at a bus or tram stop or in and immediately outside publicly accessible buildings may be fined. A fixed penalty may also be issued to persons attending banned events or holding an unpermitted private event. It is hoped that the threat of being issued with an immediate and rapid fixed penalty will encourage people to respect the rules and that this system will reduce pressure on the courts. Federal government to cover cost of vaccinations in pharmaciesFrom 1 February the federal government will also assume the cost of vaccinations carried out by pharmacists, on the same conditions as in vaccination centres. This means that the cantons can include pharmacies in their vaccination programmes.Testing of FFP masksFFP masks in federal or cantonal stocks that may not meet safety standards are to be retested; if they are found not to be up to standard, they may no longer be used. Today the Federal Council amended COVID-19 Ordinance 3 to reflect this new requirement. At the beginning of the pandemic, large numbers of FFP masks were purchased to equip health workers, and some of these masks may not meet the required safety standards.Slow decline in case numbersThe epidemiological situation in Switzerland is improving only slowly; there is just a slight decline in the number of new infections. The drop in the number of hospitalisations and deaths is clearer. However, the pressure on intensive care units remains high. The number of cases of the new virus strains continues to double each week. The Federal Council is greatly concerned by this trend; its objective remains to achieve a clear and rapid drop in case numbers. Compensation for creative artistsThe Federal Council also decided today to call on Parliament to grant compensation for loss of earnings to creative artists retroactively to 1 November 2020. This will close a loophole in the support measures on offer. Creative artists can apply for compensation as soon as the cantons, which are responsible for making the payments, have adapted their legislation accordingly. It is believed that more than half of COVID-19 infections are transmitted by people who do not display symptoms and are unaware that they actually have the virus. The federal government has therefore permitted the testing of asymptomatic persons from mid-December as a further precautionary measure, e.g. in care homes, hotels and in the workplace. It will now assume the costs in order to encourage such institutions to conduct rapid tests, and this can be done by their own staff. Negative test results do not have to be reported; if a person tests positive to a rapid test, they must undergo a PCR test and the result must be reported. By extending the testing strategy, the government hopes that local outbreaks of the virus, for example in schools, can be identified and contained at an early stage. This is particularly important in view of the fact that new, more infectious strains of the coronavirus are currently spreading in Switzerland. In such cases, the federal government will now also assume the cost of testing people who do not display symptoms. The local canton must present a test plan to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) containing details of where testing will take place, who will be tested, how often and the type of test to be used. The FOPH testing criteria are to be amended accordingly. The extended testing strategy requires an amendment to COVID-19 Ordinance 3, which enters into force tomorrow, Thursday 28th January. Quarantine rules modifiedThe current quarantine rules are to be adapted to include a test-and-release strategy. Until now anyone who has come into contact with an infected person has had to go into quarantine for ten days. Under the new rules, a person may leave quarantine after seven days if after this time they have a negative result from an antigen rapid test or a PCR test (molecular biological analysis), and are authorised to do so by the local cantonal authorities. The person must pay for the test themselves and must wear a mask and continue to socially distance until the full ten days' quarantine is over, unless they remain at home (or in the place they are quarantining - holiday apartment, hotel etc.). If their test result is positive, they must isolate immediately.Reduced travel quarantineThe new test-and-release strategy also applies to persons arriving in Switzerland from a country or region with a high risk of infection. On arrival, these travellers must present valid proof of a negative PCR test result that is no more than 72 hours old. They then have to quarantine for ten days; they can leave quarantine after seven days if they again test negative (antigen rapid test or PCR test). All persons arriving by air even from a country that is not considered high risk must be able to show a negative PCR test result before boarding the plane. Contact tracing extendedUntil now, only the contact details of people arriving in Switzerland from a high-risk country or region have been recorded. From now on, all persons arriving from abroad by air, boat, bus or train must complete an online form on arrival.

Coronavirus: Federal Council to cover vaccination costs for further groups,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82229.html,2021-02-03,"Bern, 03.02.2021 - At its meeting on 3 February, the Federal Council took the decision to extend free access to the coronavirus vaccination to further groups of people in Switzerland. The federal government will now cover the cost of vaccinations for people who live in Switzerland but do not have mandatory health insurance cover, such as diplomats. The vaccination will also be free for cross-border workers employed by Swiss healthcare and care institutions who are not insured in Switzerland. The aim of covering vaccination costs for a wider circle of people is to encourage those living in Switzerland who are not covered by Swiss health insurance to get vaccinated. The measure will mainly benefit diplomats and staff at international organisations, as well as cross-border workers employed at Swiss healthcare and care institutions who have health insurance cover at their place of residence. The new arrangement affects around 150,000 people. If all of these people were to be billed individually, the administrative costs would be higher than the cost of the vaccination itself. A number of neighbouring countries have adopted a similar practice. The Federal Council expects to incur additional costs of CHF 3.5 million. The arrangement applies retrospectively from 4 January.

Coronavirus: Federal Council plans first cautious steps to reopen from 1 March,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82371.html,2021-02-17,"Bern, 17.02.2021 - The number of new infections with the coronavirus has steadily declined in recent weeks. However, the epidemiological situation remains precarious because of the new, more infectious variants of the virus. At its meeting on 17 February, the Federal Council analysed the situation. It proposes a cautious, gradual easing of measures to allow society to start to reopen and economic activity to resume. At the same time, every effort should be made to prevent a third wave of the disease. In an initial step, the Federal Council aims to allow activities that carry a low risk of infection. From 1 March, shops, museums and library reading rooms should be allowed to reopen, as well as outside spaces at zoos and botanical gardens, and at sports and leisure facilities. Private outdoor events for up to 15 people should also be permitted. In addition, young people up to the age of 18 should once again be able to take part in most sporting and cultural activities without restriction. The Federal Council will take a final decision on these first steps on 24 February after consulting with the cantons. The number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths has continued to fall in recent weeks. The pressure on the healthcare system has also lessened as a result. Nevertheless, the epidemiological situation remains uncertain, as new variants of the virus continue to spread in Switzerland; according to the COVID-19 Science Task Force, the percentage they represent of new infections is currently doubling every 10 to 14 days. The Task Force calculates that there is likely to be a slowdown in the rate at which case numbers fall in the coming weeks. A renewed rise in infections remains possible. The number of people in Switzerland who have been vaccinated is still too low to have an influence on theepidemiological situation. Risk-based and gradual opening strategyThe Federal Council proposes a gradual reopening from 1 March. Activities that carry a low risk of infection will be allowed first. More activities should be permitted progressively if infection rates are favourable and as vaccination rates rise. Further reopening phases will follow at monthly intervals as long as the epidemiological situation allows. That way, there is sufficient time between phases to monitor developments. By taking this cautious approach, the Federal Council is aiming to achieve a gradual normalisation of social and economic life and at the same time avoid a third wave of the disease. How the risk will be assessed These steps should be introduced nationally on the basis of simple principles. The decisive factor for early opening will be whether a mask can be worn during a certain activity and whether it is possible to respect social distancing rules. Other factors include situation-specific aspects such as the number of people involved, whether an activity takes place indoors or outdoors, and the extent to which people move around in the process. The Federal Council will also take account of measures that have proved to put a strain on the economy and society, and especially on young people.First phase: shops, museums, zoosIn an initial phase, all shops should be allowed to reopen from 1 March. The number of customers must however be limited. Capacity restrictions will also apply to shopping centres as a whole.Museums and reading rooms at libraries and archives will be allowed to reopen. People will be allowed to use outside spaces at leisure and recreation facilities, such as at zoos, botanical gardens and amusement parks. Visitors will still have to wear a face mask and maintain social distancing, and capacity restrictions will also apply. Sports facilities such as ice rinks, tennis courts, football pitches and athletics grounds will be allowed to reopen. In addition to capacity restrictions, face masks will have to be worn and social distancing rules respected; only groups of up to five people will be allowed; recreational matches and competitive events at adult level will not be permitted. Private outdoor events with up to 15 people will also be permitted.More opportunities for young people  The coronavirus-related restrictions have been particularly tough on children and young people, particularly in terms of their mental health. The measures applicable to children and young people up to the age of 16 with regard to sporting and cultural activities are already somewhat less restrictive. The Federal Council would like to raise the age limit for restrictions to 18 and extend the range of sporting and cultural activities allowed. In addition, child and youth social work facilities should also be accessible.Second phase before EasterA second phase of reopening should commence on 1 April. The intention would be to allow the public to attend cultural and sporting events under closely defined conditions, and to allow indoor sports and the opening of outdoor restaurant seating areas. This will only be possible if the epidemiological situation so allows. In deciding whether or not to ease measures, the Federal Council will take certain values into account: the positivity rate must be below five per cent, the occupancy rate of intensive care beds by COVID-19 patients must be below 25 per cent, the average reproduction rate over the previous 7-day period must be below 1, and the 14-day incidence rate on 24 March should not be higher than it was on 1 March. Even if these targets are achieved, this will not automatically mean that measures will be eased. The Federal Council will base its decision on a combination of these values.Consultation with the cantonsThe Federal Council will take a decision on the first phase of easing measures and how to proceed thereafter at its meeting on 24 February, after consulting the cantons. All other measures introduced by the Federal Council on 18 December 2020 and on 13 January will continue to apply for a month until the end of March.Clarification of entry rules regarding childrenThe Federal Council has amended the ordinance concerned in order to clarify the entry restrictions that have been in force since 8 February. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from the requirement to be tested on entering the country. Furthermore, people entering the country on business for only a brief period, such as lorry drivers, are not required to fill out an entry form. The number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths has continued to fall in recent weeks. The pressure on the healthcare system has also lessened as a result. Nevertheless, the epidemiological situation remains uncertain, as new variants of the virus continue to spread in Switzerland; according to the COVID-19 Science Task Force, the percentage they represent of new infections is currently doubling every 10 to 14 days.

Coronavirus: Federal Council takes first cautious step to reopen from 1 March,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82462.html,2021-02-24,"Bern, 24.02.2021 - From Monday, 1 March, shops, museums and library reading rooms can reopen, along with outdoor sports and leisure facilities, zoos and botanical gardens. Outdoor events for family and friends and sports and cultural activities involving up to 15 people will also be permitted. Young people up to the age of 20 will be able to take part in most sporting and cultural activities without restriction. This is what the Federal Council decided at its meeting on 24 February 2021 after consulting the cantons. The next stage in reopening is scheduled for 22 March, but will depend on the epidemiological situation. With this cautious reopening, the Federal Council is aiming to achieve a gradual normalisation of social and economic life, even though the epidemiological situation remains precarious because new, more infectious variants of the virus are circulating. The initial reopening phase from 1 March essentially involves activities that allow people to wear masks and maintain social distancing, and that only involve small numbers of people or meeting outdoors. In addition to the risk of infection, the Federal Council has also taken social and economic factors into consideration. Open again: shops, museums, zoos, sports facilities, up to 15 people outdoorsAll shops can reopen, but customer numbers will be restricted. Museums and the reading rooms in libraries and archives will also be allowed to open. Outdoor areas at zoos, botanical gardens and leisure facilities will welcome visitors again, but in restricted numbers, wearing masks and maintaining the required distance. Outdoor sports facilities, such as ice rinks, tennis courts, football pitches and athletics grounds will also reopen, again with restricted numbers of users, who must wear masks and maintain the required distance. Competitions in adult grassroots sports and other events remain prohibited. Outdoor gatherings of family and friends involving up to 15 people will be permitted. Under 20s: no restrictions on sports or cultural activities, but no spectatorsThe Federal Council has expanded the range of activities permitted for children, teenagers and young adults. It is raising the age limit at which restrictions on sports and cultural activities apply from 16 to 20 (i.e. to include those born in 2001 and later). In addition, sports competitions and concerts will again be permitted, but without spectators or an audience. Children's and youth choirs will be allowed sing again. In addition, social facilities for children and teenagers, such as youth clubs, will also reopen.Consultation with the cantons: some concerns consideredThe cantons support the Federal Council's risk-based reopening strategy and welcome the measures proposed. In reaching its decision, the Federal Council took certain concerns raised by the cantons and other parties into consideration, for example in setting a date for the next stage of reopening, in easing the measures imposed on young adults and in allowing outdoor gatherings. However, in view of the precarious epidemiological situation, the Federal Council decided not to open outdoor areas at restaurants from 1 March, despite a small majority of cantons being in favour of doing so. Targets for further reopening on 22 MarchThe next stage in reopening is scheduled for 22 March; consultations with the cantons will begin on 12 March and the Federal Council will take its decision on 19 March. It is planned to include cultural and sporting events with a limited number of spectators, changes to the requirement to work from home, indoor sports and the opening of outdoor areas at restaurants. The Federal Council has set targets that must be achieved before the next step is taken: the positivity rate must be below five per cent, fewer than 250 beds in intensive care units should be occupied by COVID-19 patients, and the average reproduction rate over the previous seven-day period must be below 1. In addition, the 14-day incidence rate on 17 March should not be higher than it is when measures are eased on 1 March. The Federal Council will make a general assessment of these targets in reaching its decision. If the epidemiological situation improves in the coming weeks, it will also consider reopening indoor areas in restaurants and allowing other indoor activities, and reintroducing face-to-face teaching at universities from 22 March.

Coronavirus: Federal Council proposes test offensive to accompany relaxation of measures – free tests for everyone,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82600.html,2021-03-05,"Bern, 05.03.2021 - The Federal Council wants to massively expand testing in parallel to easing coronavirus restrictions. It is proposing that the Confederation should assume the cost of all tests to encourage more widespread testing. In order to improve the prevention and early detection of coronavirus outbreaks, companies and schools are to conduct regular testing. Employees at companies that test frequently can be exempted from the quarantine requirement for persons who have had contact with someone who has tested positive. In addition, the Federal Council wants to provide each member of the public with five free self-tests a month as soon as reliable tests are available. To ensure that everyone can be tested immediately, all tests in pharmacies and test centres will be free of charge, even for people without symptoms. The cost of expanding testing is estimated at over CHF 1 billion. The Federal Council will make a final decision after consulting the cantons on 12 March. In order to interrupt chains of infection in a targeted manner, it is necessary to rapidly identify who is carrying the virus. Testing is therefore a key element in pandemic control. Now that testing and laboratory capacities are available and self-tests can soon be used, the Federal Council wants to massively expand testing with free tests for all. This will happen in parallel to the gradual relaxing of restrictions on social activities and economic life. Because the more infectious virus variants are spreading at an increasing rate, there must be stricter prevention and earlier detection of local outbreaks.Free tests expected from 15 MarchThe Federal Council has expanded the testing strategy several times. Currently the Confederation not only funds testing for persons with symptoms, but also for asymptomatic persons in care homes and schools, and to combat local outbreaks. The Confederation is now to assume the cost of all tests from 15 March.Regular testing in companies and schoolsPeople working in companies and attending schools are to undergo regular testing using pooled saliva samples. In this form of testing, the test persons' samples are not analysed individually, but in a single pooled sample. This can greatly reduce the amount of material and time required. Regular testing in companies is not a substitute for precautionary measures, but serves as an additional form of protection. Participation is voluntary. The cantons will be able to exempt persons working for companies that test frequently from the requirement to quarantine in the case of contact with an infected person.Self-tests for everyoneSuccess in controlling the pandemic has, since the beginning, relied on the public's sense of responsibility. The Federal Council now wants to make it easier for people to self-test as well. It would like everyone to be able to test themselves regularly, even if they have no symptoms, and to have access to five self-tests per month. However, as there is not yet enough information available on the use of self-tests in asymptomatic persons, the Federal Office of Public Health has not yet approved these types of test. The Federal Council therefore proposes that the Confederation also meet the cost of all rapid tests in pharmacies and test centres, including for cross-border commuters.More testing also involves riskExpanding the testing strategy carries a degree of risk, as each test result just gives a snapshot of a person's state of health. What is more, self-tests are much less reliable than PCR tests. A negative test should not lead to a false sense of security or irresponsible behaviour. It will still be necessary to wear a mask and observe social distancing. People who have a positive rapid test or self-test result need to take a PCR test and gointo isolation immediately. It is still not decided whether people will need to show a negative test result in order to take part in certain events or access certain areas.Cost estimated at CHF 1 billionThe cost of expanding the testing strategy is estimated at over CHF 1 billion in 2021.

Coronavirus: consultation on second phase of reopening despite precarious situation,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82678.html,2021-03-12,"Bern, 12.03.2021 - It is currently unclear how the epidemic will develop. Case numbers have now been rising for several days, as is the case in several neighbouring countries. There are signs that this could be the start of a third wave. At its meeting on 12 March, the Federal Council decided to begin consultations on a second phase of reopening, as announced on 24 February. If the epidemiological situation allows, from 22 March events with spectators or audiences will be allowed with restrictions, as well as gatherings at home involving up to ten people, and sporting and cultural activities in groups. Restaurants will be allowed to open outdoor seating areas. It has not yet been decided when the second phase of reopening might be permitted or what form it would take. The Federal Council will decide on further steps at its meeting on 19 March. It has also confirmed its decision that the Confederation will assume the costs of all rapid tests, including those of all asymptomatic cases. The epidemiological situation remains extremely precarious and it is unclear how the situation will evolve. Switzerland may be facing a third wave of the pandemic. That is the presumption, although the impact of the first phase of reopening on 1 March cannot yet be assessed. For the Federal Council it is therefore unclear at the present time whether the epidemiological situation on 22 March will allow the second phase of reopening to go ahead. The general trend should become clearer over the coming days. The Federal Council will be guided in its decision by the indicator values. Values for three of the four indicators are currently being exceeded. In view of the uncertain epidemiological situation, the Federal Council has not yet determined when and in what form a third phase of opening can take place. Events with spectators: outdoors with 150 people, indoors with 50 peopleAs announced, the Federal Council is sending out its proposals to the cantons for the second phase of reopening. Under the proposals, events with spectators or audiences will once again be allowed, albeit with restrictions. The maximum number of visitors will be limited to 150 people at outdoor venues - such as at football matches or open-air concerts - and 50 people indoors - such as at cinemas, theatres and concerts. Furthermore, attendance will be limited to a third of the venue's maximum capacity. There will be a seating requirement and masks must be worn at all times. A distance of 1.5 metres must be maintained between visitors at all times, or a seat left free. Food and drink will not be allowed and there should be no intervals.Other events: maximum of 15 peopleIn addition to the private events and sporting and cultural activities already permitted, other events involving up to 15 people will also be allowed. This includes, for example, guided tours in museums, meetings of club members and other entertainment and leisure events.Private gatherings at home involving up to 10 peopleThe limit for indoor gatherings of friends and family will be increased from 5 people to 10. It is recommended that private gatherings be limited to members of just a few households. Private outdoor gatherings are already limited to 15 people.Restaurant outside seating areas to reopenRestaurants and bars will be able to reopen their outside seating areas. Customers must be seated and masks may only be removed to consume food and drink. A maximum of four people will be allowed per table and each person's contact details must be recorded. Tables must be 1.5 metres apart or have a screen placed between them. Clubs and discos remain closed. The hospitality sector will continue to receive financial support; this does not depend on whether outside seating areas are permitted to reopen.Publicly accessible facilities and businessesPublicly accessible leisure and recreation facilities will also be allowed to reopen under similar conditions to shops and museums. This means that all areas of zoos and botanical gardens can open. Masks must always be worn in indoor areas and distancing rules respected. However, indoor areas of spa facilities and swimming pools are to remain closed.Sporting and cultural activities for adults involving up to 15 people  The restrictions regarding recreational sporting and cultural activities for adults are also to be eased for individuals or groups involving up to 15 people. When outdoors a mask must be worn or the required distance of 1.5 metres respected. When indoors it is necessary to wear a mask and respect distancing rules. Exceptions will be made for activities where it is not possible to wear a mask, such as during endurance training in fitness centres, or when singing in a choir. Prior testing is recommended. Sports involving physical contact will be permitted outdoors if a mask is worn, but will still not be permitted indoors. Matches and competitions are not permitted in any sports. It is still recommended that sporting and cultural activities take place outdoors.Face-to-face teaching at higher and continuing education institutionsFace-to-face teaching will once again be allowed on a limited basis in post-compulsory schooling. There may be no more than 15 people in a class and the room may not be filled beyond a third of its capacity. Face masks must be worn and social distancing rules apply.Face mask wearing relaxed for care home residents; reduced quarantine requirement for businessesCare home residents who have been vaccinated will no longer be required to wear masks. For businesses, if 80 per cent of staff physically present at the workplace are tested at least once a week, the requirement to quarantine after contact with an infected person will be lifted. The requirement to quarantine after contact with an infected person will be lifted for people who have been vaccinated.More widespread testing: plans confirmed following consultationAfter consulting the cantons, the Federal Council decided at its meeting on 12 March to expand the testing strategy without making any significant changes to the plans. Greater prevention, early identification of local outbreaks and more widespread testing will mean that restrictions on economic and social life can be lifted sooner. From 15 March, the Confederation will assume the costs of rapid tests at all authorised testing centres, including for people without symptoms. As soon as reliable self-tests become available, everyone will be able to obtain five self-tests a month. In addition, businesses and schools will be able to conduct pool testing free of charge. Alert apps in Switzerland and Germany to be made interoperableFinally, the Federal Council today approved an amendment to the Proximity Tracing System Ordinance along with an agreement with the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. The amendment creates a legal basis allowing the SwissCovid app to be interoperable with Germany's Corona-Warn app. Today, cross-border commuters have to have both apps installed on their mobile phones and activate either one or the other depending on where they are. It is not technically possible to have both apps activated at the same time. As soon as the apps are interoperable, it will no longer be necessary to have both apps installed. Swiss app users will then be notified if they have been in contact with someone using the German app who has tested positive.

Coronavirus: restrictions relaxed for private gatherings from 22 March; further easing postponed due to rising case numbers,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82762.html,2021-03-19,"Bern, 19.03.2021 - At its meeting on 19 March, the Federal Council decided to relax restrictions regarding indoor gatherings of family and friends from five to a maximum of ten people. In view of the fact that case numbers have been rising since the end of February, the risk of an uncontrolled increase in cases is currently too great to allow any further measures to be eased. Furthermore, not enough people have been vaccinated to prevent a sharp rise in hospital admissions. The Federal Council does not wish to jeopardise the good starting point for the vaccination campaign for the coming months. The Federal Council has defined a set of indicator values in the event that stricter measures have to be imposed because of a deterioration in the epidemiological situation. It has also approved the tariff agreement negotiated by involved parties on the reimbursement of COVID-19 vaccinations. The epidemiological situation has been deteriorating since the end of February. The number of cases of infection continues to rise. At present, case numbers are likely to double every three to four weeks. Three of the four indicator values set by the Federal Council for the second phase of reopening have been exceeded for several days now: the 14-day incidence has risen to over 200 per 100,000 inhabitants, the positivity rate is over 5 per cent, and the reproductive number is significantly higher than 1 at 1.14. Only the occupancy rate for intensive care beds with COVID-19 patients is below the defined indicator value.No further easing of measuresIn the current epidemiological situation, the Federal Council does not believe that Switzerland should proceed with the second phase of reopening as outlined in the consultation. Case numbers are also rising in all of our neighbouring countries despite the fact that the measures in force in certain countries are significantly stricter than in Switzerland. There are also indications that the new virus variants are not only more infectious, but also more deadly. The new variants now account for over 80 per cent of infections. Moreover, the number of vaccinations is still too low to prevent a sharp rise in hospital admissions, and efforts to conduct more widespread testing have only just begun.Private gatherings: ten people instead of fiveWith Easter approaching, the Federal Council will allow indoor gatherings of family and friends involving up to ten people instead of five from 22 March. Children are included in that number. The public are nevertheless encouraged to exercise caution and limit gatherings to members of only a few households. Before going to private gatherings they should also take up the opportunity to take a free test. The measures already in place to combat the epidemic are to be extended. The aim is not to jeopardise the good starting point for the vaccination campaign over the coming months nor the prospects of a further phase of reopening after Easter. The Federal Council will decide on the next steps to take on 14 April. The package of measures set out in last week's consultation will form the basis of the next phase of reopening.Evaluation of consultation findingsThe consultation revealed that a clear majority of the cantons would welcome a gradual reopening with accompanying measures. Many of the responses called for this to happen either more extensively, in a more differentiated manner or on a different time-scale. Almost all of those who responded to the consultation called for a relaxation of the ban on face-to-face teaching at higher education and continuing education institutions. All supported the reopening of restaurant outdoor seating areas from 22 March, while half of the cantons also called for indoor areas to reopen if the situation allows. Some responses also expressed a desire for greater caution before proceeding with further reopening steps. The Federal Council discussed these responses as well as the National Council's declaration calling for a more extensive reopening.Indicator values for renewed tightening of measuresAt its meeting today, the Federal Council also discussed at what point it would have to consider tightening measures again if the situation were to drastically deteriorate. One of the factors to be taken into account is the number of people vaccinated. The Federal Council proposes a three-stage plan. Stricter indicator values are needed until all those in high-risk groups have been vaccinated (stage one). A key value is a 14-day incidence of no more than 350. Other indicator values to be considered include the occupancy of intensive care unit beds with COVID-19 patients, hospitalisations and the reproductive number. These values will not automatically determine what happens, but serve as a basis for any decision the Federal Council may take. Once all those in high-risk groups have been vaccinated (stage two), indicator values may not have to be as strict. However, the epidemic must be under control. Once all those who wish to be vaccinated have received their vaccinations (stage three), there should be no further need for lockdown measures and indicator values should no longer be necessary. However, all this depends on the impact that new virus variants may have.Adjustment of flat-rate tariff for COVID-19 vaccinationsToday, the Federal Council also approved adjustments to the tariff agreement negotiated by tariff partners for the reimbursement of COVID-19 vaccinations under compulsory health insurance. A separate flat-rate tariff of CHF 24.50 per vaccination has been agreed for medical practices until the end of June, dropping to CHF 16.50 from July. Furthermore, the Confederation will reimburse pharmacies that administer the vaccine at a flat rate of CHF 24.50. The flat-rate tariff for vaccination centres will remain at CHF 14.50 per vaccination. The cost of vaccination against COVID-19 will be covered in full. No deductible or retention fee will be charged.Report of the National Advisory Commission on Biomedical EthicsToday, the Federal Council also acknowledged the report of the National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics (NCE) entitled ‘Federal Council measures in managing the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic from an ethical perspective'. The epidemiological situation has been deteriorating since the end of February. The number of cases of infection continues to rise. At present, case numbers are likely to double every three to four weeks. Three of the four indicator values set by the Federal Council for the second phase of reopening have been exceeded for several days now: the 14-day incidence has risen to over 200 per 100,000 inhabitants, the positivity rate is over 5 per cent, and the reproductive number is significantly higher than 1 at 1.14.

Coronavirus: Next phase of reopening on 19 April,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-83106.html,2021-04-14,"Bern, 14.04.2021 - The Federal Council is continuing its strategy of taking cautious, gradual steps towards reopening. At its meeting on 14 April, it decided on further reopening measures. From Monday, 19 April, it will again be possible to hold events with audiences and spectators subject to restrictions, for example at sports stadiums, cinemas, theatres and concert venues. Indoor sports and cultural activities will also be allowed, as well as certain matches and competitions. Restaurants will be able to reopen outside seating areas. Although the situation remains precarious, the Federal Council deems the risk associated with these reopening steps to be acceptable. It is possible to wear a mask and maintain social distancing in all of the activities that are once again to be permitted, indeed, barring a few exceptions, it is a requirement. Furthermore, good progress is being made with the vaccination of at-risk groups, and testing schemes are continually being expanded. The epidemiological situation remains precarious and has continued to deteriorate in recent weeks. Four of the five indicators for reopening are not currently being met. It is also not yet clear whether gatherings of family and friends over the Easter period have brought an increase in infections. Conditions met for moderate steps towards reopening The Federal Council nevertheless considers that moderate steps towards reopening are acceptable. Hospital admissions are rising relatively slowly in view of the number of cases of infection, and good progress is being made in vaccinating at-risk groups: almost 50 per cent of those over 80 and around 30 per cent of 70-79-year-olds have been fully vaccinated. Furthermore, the situation in intensive care units is relatively stable. In its assessment, the Federal Council also took into account the social and economic impact of the measures, especially on young people. The steps announced today largely correspond to the proposals for a second phase of reopening sent out for consultation in mid-March, but which were only implemented in small part. With a few exceptions, activities with a moderate risk are allowed provided it is possible to wear masks and comply with social distancing rules. Steps to reopen with calculated risk The Federal Council is aware of the risks of reopening. If hospital admissions rise, this is now more likely to affect younger people. Today, more than half of those hospitalised are under 65 years of age. There is a risk that the easing of measures will have to be reversed depending on how the situation in the hospitals develops. The Federal Council therefore appeals to the public to continue to exercise caution, especially those in high-risk groups who will be fully vaccinated in the next few weeks and thus well protected against infection and severe illness.  Restaurant outside seating areas to reopen Restaurants and bars will be able to reopen their outside seating areas from 19 April. Customers must be seated and masks may only be removed to consume food and drink. A maximum of four people will be allowed per table and each person’s contact details must be recorded. Tables must be 1.5 metres apart or have a screen placed between them. Clubs and discos remain closed. Given that many restaurants and bars will still not be able to cover their costs despite these steps, economic support for the hospitality sector will continue as before. Publicly accessible facilities and businesses Publicly accessible leisure and recreation facilities will also be allowed to reopen under similar conditions to shops and museums. This means that all areas of zoos and botanical gardens can open. Masks must always be worn in indoor areas and distancing rules respected. However, indoor areas of spa facilities and swimming pools will remain closed. Events with spectators: outdoors with 100 people, indoors with 50 people Events with spectators or audiences will once again be allowed. The maximum number of visitors will be limited to 100 people at outdoor venues – such as at football matches or open-air concerts – and 50 people indoors – such as at cinemas, theatres and concerts. Furthermore, attendance will be limited to a third of the venue’s maximum capacity. There will be a seating requirement and masks must be worn at all times. A distance of 1.5 metres must be maintained between visitors at all times, or a seat left free. Food and drink will not be allowed and there should be no intervals.  Other events: no more than 15 people Other events involving up to 15 people will also be permitted in addition to the private gatherings and sporting and cultural activities already allowed. These include guided tours at museums, club gatherings or other leisure and recreational events. Mask-wearing and social distancing rules still apply.  Sporting and cultural activities for adults involving up to 15 people The restrictions regarding recreational sporting and cultural activities for adults are also to be eased for individuals or groups involving up to 15 people. Competitions and matches will also permitted under these conditions. Outdoors a mask must be worn or the required distance of 1.5 metres respected. Indoors it will be necessary both to wear a mask and respect distancing rules. Exceptions will be made for activities where it is not possible to wear a mask, such as during endurance training in fitness centres, or when singing in a choir. In these exceptional cases, stricter distancing rules apply. Sports involving physical contact are still not permitted indoors, and are only permitted outdoors if masks are worn. It is still recommended that sporting and cultural activities take place outdoors and that participants get themselves tested before taking part in sporting and cultural activities.   Face-to-face teaching at higher and continuing education institutions Face-to-face teaching will once again be allowed on a limited basis in post-compulsory schooling. There may be no more than 50 people in a class and the room may not be filled beyond a third of its capacity. Face masks must be worn and social distancing rules apply.  More widespread testing: No quarantine for businesses Employees at companies that have a testing plan and that offer tests to staff working on site at least once a week are not required to quarantine if they have been in contact at work with someone who has tested positive. Old people's and nursing homes can exempt residents who have been vaccinated from the requirement to wear a mask. This also applies to residents who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection. Supply of important and promising medicines Today, the Federal Council also took decisions on the supply of important and promising medicines against COVID-19. Monoclonal antibody combination therapies and other therapies should be made available in Switzerland as soon as possible. The federal government will cover the costs of these treatments in an initial phase until they are covered by health insurers. The FDHA has also been tasked to work with the EAER and FDF to examine in detail ways in which the federal government can boost the production and development of COVID-19 relevant medicines (incl. vaccines) in Switzerland. The federal government now has greater scope to act following the amendment of the COVID-19 Act on 20 March. The epidemiological situation remains precarious and has continued to deteriorate in recent weeks. Four of the five indicators for reopening are not currently being met. It is also not yet clear whether gatherings of family and friends over the Easter period have brought an increase in infections.

Coronavirus: Federal Council adopts strategy for the coming months and launches consultation on fourth round of reopening steps,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-83531.html,2021-05-12,"Bern, 12.05.2021 - At its meeting on 12 May, the Federal Council adopted a 3-phase model setting out its strategy for the coming months. At the end of May, when all those at especially high risk who wish to be vaccinated have received their jabs, the government will move from a protection phase to a stabilisation phase and initiate a fourth round of reopening steps. If the epidemiological situation allows, restaurants, for example, will be allowed to resume service indoors on Monday, 31 May. The maximum number of people allowed to attend public events will be increased. For businesses that carry out regular testing, working from home will become a recommendation rather than a requirement. The Federal Council will send out the proposals to the cantons, the relevant parliamentary committees and social partners for consultation. A decision will then be taken on 26 May. The epidemiological situation is easing in terms of case numbers, hospitalisations and intensive care unit capacity. The public are continuing to observe the protective measures, and the reopening steps introduced on 19 April have not as yet had a negative impact on the spread of the pandemic. The Federal Council is optimistic that the situation in hospitals will continue to ease in the coming weeks and that a further round of reopening steps will be possible at the end of May. This will depend on the vaccination campaign continuing at a high pace and on all those – especially those at high risk – continuing to take measures to protect themselves until they have been vaccinated. The Federal Council is putting forward the following proposals for consultation. Events with spectators: up to 100 people indoors and 300 people outdoors For events with spectators or audiences, there will be a limit of 100 instead of 50 people indoors, and 300 instead of 100 people outdoors. Half of the capacity of venues may now be used instead of only a third as before. The same applies to political and religious events. Other events, such as club events or guided tours, will be allowed inside and outside with a maximum of 30 people instead of 15 as before. Dancing events remain prohibited. As the risk of transmission is higher at private events, the maximum number of people will continue to be 10 indoors and 15 outdoors. Restaurants: indoor service as long as case numbers do not rise The Federal Council is proposing that restaurants should be allowed to resume service indoors with precautionary measures in place. From an epidemiological perspective this step is the most fraught as it means people from different households can come into contact with each other indoors without masks. For this step to be introduced, case numbers will have to fall or remain stable. The same rules should apply as for outdoor seating areas: distancing or screens, no more than four people per table, contact details of all guests to be recorded, seating only, masks to be worn at tables when not eating or drinking. The requirement to wear a mask when sitting outdoors will be lifted. The cantons are responsible for monitoring compliance with the precautionary measures.  Amateur sport: larger groups and football matches in all leagues A maximum of 30 people instead of 15 will be allowed to play sport together. Spectators will also be permitted at sports events, including matches. The rules for public events with 100 people indoors and 300 people outdoors apply. In order to allow amateur league football matches to resume, a group size of 50 instead of 30 people will apply for team sports in national and regional leagues. Team sport matches are only allowed to take place outdoors. With regard to indoor sports, the following rules still apply: no more than 15 people in a room if no masks are worn. Contact sports such as judo or wrestling are only permitted indoors without masks in fixed groups of four people. The space requirement for less strenuous sporting activities carried out indoors (e.g. yoga) will be reduced from 15 to 10 square metres per person. Cultural activities: larger groups possible As with sport, the maximum group size for cultural activities will also be increased to 30 people. At performances and practice sessions necessary to prepare for performances, the maximum group size will be 50 – both indoors and out. The space requirement for brass bands will be reduced from 25 to 10 square metres per person. Amateur and professional choir performances will once again be allowed. No requirement to work from home for businesses that conduct regular tests Working from home will be a recommendation rather than a requirement for businesses that carry out regular testing. To make it even easier for businesses to carry out tests, the federal government will not only assume the cost of testing, but also of pooling. Since 18 January, employers have been required to instruct staff to work from home depending on the type of activity and where practicable. Once everyone who so wishes has been vaccinated (start of normalisation phase), the rules on working from home will be eased without further restrictions. The rules to protect people at high risk in the workplace will be extended. Higher education institutions: more face-to face teaching possible At higher education institutions, the 50-person limit for face-to-face teaching will be lifted. The prerequisite is a testing plan as part of the cantonal test strategy and cantonal approval. Half of the capacity may now be used instead of only a third as before. Face masks must be worn and social distancing rules still apply. Spa facilities open Thermal baths and spa facilities will be allowed to reopen. Activities can be carried out without masks, but while observing social distancing rules and with 15 square metres per person. No quarantine for those already vaccinated People who have recovered from COVID and those who have been vaccinated will be exempt from contact and travel quarantine. It can be assumed that they cannot transmit the disease. A decision will be taken on the vaccines to which these exemptions apply and for how long. With a view to the summer holidays, the Federal Council will also adapt the government’s travel advice. A risk of infection with the coronavirus exists in all regions of the world. Before going on holiday, travellers should read the information and recommendations issued by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and, in particular, the current list of countries and regions with an increased risk of infection. Anyone entering Switzerland from one of these countries or regions must go into quarantine. Travel to countries or regions with new virus mutations is not recommended. These countries and regions are recorded on a list. 3-phase model adopted Today, the Federal Council also adopted its strategy for the coming months. To this end, it has defined three phases until all adults who so wish have been vaccinated, and the measures to protect against COVID-19 can largely be lifted (see fact sheet). This 3-phase model was well received in the consultation. Almost all cantons agree with the model and welcome the strategy, which is why only minor adjustments have been made. The cantons are aware that the model is also associated with risks - for example, that people who are unable to be vaccinated are exposed to an increased risk in the longer term. The first phase (protection phase) lasts until all those at especially high risk who wish to be vaccinated have received their jabs. This phase is expected to be completed by the end of May. In the second phase (stabilisation phase), the entire adult population will have access to the vaccination. Once all adults who so wish are fully vaccinated, the third phase (normalisation phase) can begin. However, the virus will continue to circulate even after all those who to be vaccinated have been. Further round of reopening steps planned The Federal Council envisages further rounds of reopening steps in the second and third phases. On 26 May, it will take a final decision on large-scale events with more than 1,000 people; the consultation on this proposal is currently being evaluated. The Federal Council plans to launch the consultation on the next round of reopening steps on 11 June before taking a decision on 18 June. This package will include a further easing of measures for sports, cultural and other events. In the summer, the Federal Council will also discuss medium-term planning and undertake the necessary preparatory work for the winter. Amendments to various COVID-19 ordinances Even before the decision on the fourth round of reopening steps, the Federal Council made various technical adjustments to COVID-19 ordinances. This is due to new scientific findings or summer activities. -       Persons who have contracted Sars-CoV-2 and have since recovered are now no longer considered to be at particular risk for six months instead of the previous three months.  -       In view of the pool season, bathing establishments will be able to provide for exemptions from the mask requirement for certain parts of the outdoor area, such as lawns, in their precautionary measures plans.  -       For travellers entering Switzerland from a country or area where a Sars-CoV-2 variant of concern is prevalent, exemptions from the testing and quarantine requirement for entry into Switzerland will be limited.  -       Insurers are now authorised to claim back the costs of excess self-tests directly from the insured person. The costs for payment reminders will be borne by the Confederation. The epidemiological situation is easing in terms of case numbers, hospitalisations and intensive care unit capacity. The public are continuing to observe the protective measures, and the reopening steps introduced on 19 April have not as yet had a negative impact on the spread of the pandemic.

Coronavirus: Fourth round of lifting restrictions from Monday goes further than originally planned,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-83697.html,2021-05-26,"Bern, 26.05.2021 - A further round of lifting restrictions will take effect on Monday 31 May. The Federal Council is going further than proposed in the consultation, particularly with regard to events, private gatherings and restaurants. In so doing, it is responding to the improved epidemiological situation and the results of the consultation. People who have been vaccinated will now also be exempt from quarantine along with those who have recovered from COVID. At its meeting on 26 May, the Federal Council also decided when and under what conditions large-scale events can once again take place and how the organisers should be compensated if the events have to be cancelled for epidemiological reasons. Coronavirus case numbers are continuing to fall. In addition, most cantons will have completed vaccinating people at especially high risk by the end of the month. This means that the protection phase, the first phase of the Federal Council’s exit strategy, has been completed. It can now move on to the second phase, the stabilisation phase, in which the entire adult population will have access to the vaccine. So as not to jeopardise the ongoing vaccination campaign, caution is still the order of the day. In particular, the voluntary use of rapid tests can help to further reduce infections.  In this fourth round of easing restrictions, the Federal Council is going somewhat further than originally planned in the consultation. In so doing, it is taking into account the favourable situation and responding to the feedback from the consultation. The cantons broadly welcome these steps and a majority also agree with the changes to the original proposals. Public events: up to 100 people indoors and 300 people outdoors For events with spectators or audiences, there will be a limit of 100 instead of 50 people indoors, and 300 instead of 100 people outdoors. Half of the capacity of venues may now be used instead of only a third as before. The same applies to religious events. In contrast to the proposal in the consultation, seats at public events do not have to be allocated; the wearing of masks and social distancing are sufficient.  At non-spectator and non-audience events such as club meetings or guided tours, the maximum number of people will be increased to 50 instead of 15 indoors and out. This also applies to private events such as weddings or birthday parties not held at private venues. In the consultation, the Federal Council had proposed a maximum of 30 people. There are no longer any restrictions on gatherings of people in public spaces.Private gatherings: indoors 30 people, outdoors 50 people The Federal Council is increasing the limits for private gatherings from 10 to 30 people indoors, and from 15 to 50 people outdoors. A large majority of the cantons insisted on this step. In the consultation, the Federal Council had not envisaged any changes for private gatherings. Restaurants: indoor service allowed and tables for 6 outdoors As of Monday, restaurants will once again be able to serve guests indoors. The following conditions apply: distancing or screens, no more than four people per table, contact details of all guests to be recorded, seating only. Tables for six are now allowed on outdoor seating areas. Establishments will no longer have to close between 11pm and 6am. Masks do not have to be worn while sitting at a table, but do have to be worn when moving around the premises indoors and out. Staff are required to wear a mask. Food and drink may be consumed at public events while seated as long as the contact details of all those present are recorded. Public events such as public screenings or concerts are allowed to take place at restaurants as long as all requirements applicable to catering establishments are respected. Such events can be attended by up to 100 people indoors and 300 people outdoors. Amateur sports: larger groups, spectators allowed at matches and competitions A maximum of 50 people instead of 15 will be allowed to play sport together. Spectators will also be permitted. The rules for public events apply. Matches for team sports may only be held outdoors. Contact sports and activities such as partner dancing and wrestling are only permitted indoors without masks in fixed groups of four people. The space requirement for gentle sporting activities carried out indoors (e.g. yoga) will be reduced from 15 to 10 square metres per person. Thermal baths and spa facilities may reopen. Activities can be carried out without masks, but while observing social distancing rules and with 15 square metres per person. The same rules apply for indoor swimming pools.    Cultural activities: larger groups allowed As with sport, the maximum group size for cultural activities will also be increased to 50 people. Amateur cultural performances are now allowed. The rules for public events apply. The space requirement for brass bands will be reduced from 25 to 10 square metres per person. Amateur and professional choir performances will once again be allowed.  Higher education, professional education and continuing education institutions: more face-to-face teaching possibleThe 50-person limit for face-to-face teaching will be lifted at higher education, professional education and continuing education institutions, provided there is a testing plan in place and authorisation is obtained from the cantonal authorities. Capacity restrictions no longer apply. Face masks must be worn and social distancing rules still apply.    No requirement to work from home for businesses that conduct regular tests  Working from home will be a recommendation rather than a requirement for businesses that carry out weekly testing. A return to the office should be gradual so as not to jeopardise the vaccination process of staff. Since 18 January, employers have been required to instruct staff to work from home depending on the type of activity and where practicable. Once everyone who so wishes has been vaccinated (start of normalisation phase), the rules on working from home will be eased without further restrictions. The rules to protect people at high risk in the workplace will remain in place. No quarantine for those already vaccinated or recovered from COVID People who have recovered from COVID are exempt from contact and travel quarantine for a period of six months. Given that people who have been vaccinated cannot transmit the virus to a relevant extent, they too are now exempt from contact and travel quarantine for a period of six months, as well as from the requirement to be tested and provide contact details on arrival in Switzerland, as long as they have been fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved in Switzerland or by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). People under the age of 16 are also exempt from travel quarantine and the requirement to be tested on arrival in Switzerland. The exemptions from travel quarantine and the requirement to be tested do not apply to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID arriving from countries with virus variants of significant concern. Further round of reopening before the summer Because more restrictions than originally planned are to be lifted at the end of May, the intention now is to have just one further round of reopening before the summer break. This move is also supported by the cantons; it will make it easier to monitor the effects of this round of steps and means that the relevant legislation does not have to be amended several times within a short period. The Federal Council is expected to send out the next package of steps in easing restrictions for consultation on 11 June, before taking a decision on 23 or 30 June. This package will apply from 1 July. Large-scale events with over 1,000 people At its meeting today, the Federal Council also decided when and under what conditions large-scale events may once again be allowed to take place and how the organisers should be compensated if the events, authorised by the cantons, are not able to go ahead for epidemiological reasons (protective shield rules). It amended its proposals following the consultation but is still pursuing a three-step plan.  Step 1: Pilot events from 1 June Pilot events will be possible from 1 June. A maximum of 600 people will be able to attend indoor events, as proposed in the consultation. Outdoor pilot events may be attended by up to 1,000 people instead of the 600 originally planned. Five instead of three pilot events can be held per canton. In order for the first pilot events to be approved as quickly as possible, the corresponding ordinance will come into force tomorrow. The requirement to wear a face mask when seated at an outdoor event will be lifted. Step 2: Large-scale events from 1 July Large-scale events will once again be possible from 1 July. The maximum number of people at indoor events remains at 3,000, as originally proposed. Large-scale events outdoors with compulsory seating and two-thirds capacity can now be attended by a maximum of 5,000 instead of 3,000 people, contrary to the preliminary draft. At outdoor events with standing room, such as open-air festivals, a maximum of 3,000 people are allowed, using half the available capacity and a mask requirement. Admission to large-scale events is restricted to people who have been fully vaccinated, who have recovered from COVID, or who can provide proof of a negative test result. The COVID certificate will be used as soon as it becomes available. Step 3: Large-scale events from 20 August with up to 10,000 people Large-scale events will be able to take place with a maximum of 10,000 people from 20 August. In the consultation, the proposed date was 1 September. There will be no capacity restrictions for indoor events. There will be no spectator limit at outdoor events with compulsory seating. The third step is closely linked to the entry into the stabilisation phase, when all persons wishing to be vaccinated have been. ‘Protective shield’: deductible and excess reduced In order to support the staging of events of supra-cantonal significance, in its spring session Parliament introduced a ‘protective shield’ for the events industry in Art. 11a of the COVID-19 Act. This allows public events to be planned even before it is clear whether or not the epidemiological situation allows them to go ahead. The federal government and the cantons contribute to the unmet costs of events that have to be cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. In order to benefit from this compensation, the public event concerned must have been approved by the canton and covered by the ‘protective shield’. Furthermore, the event must be expected to attract visitors from outside the canton in which it is to take place and be attended by at least 1,000 people a day. The organiser bears a deductible of CHF 5,000 per event for the uncovered costs and an excess of 10 per cent of the remaining amount. The Federal Council reduced the amount of the deductible and excess following the consultation. If the cantons bear half of the uncovered costs, the Confederation will cover the other half. The Confederation and the cantons contribute a maximum of CHF 5 million per event. This applies to events between 1 June 2021 and 30 April 2022. A legal basis for implementation has yet to be put in place in most cantons. Trade and public fairs Capacity restrictions on large-scale trade and public fairs are to be aligned with those applicable to shopping centres. In order for trade and public fairs to be able to benefit from the ‘protective shield’, such events must now be approved by the relevant cantonal authorities. Coronavirus case numbers are continuing to fall. In addition, most cantons will have completed vaccinating people at especially high risk by the end of the month. This means that the protection phase, the first phase of the Federal Council’s exit strategy, has been completed. It can now move on to the second phase, the stabilisation phase, in which the entire adult population will have access to the vaccine. So as not to jeopardise the ongoing vaccination campaign, caution is still the order of the day. In particular, the voluntary use of rapid tests can help to further reduce infections. In this fourth round of easing restrictions, the Federal Council is going somewhat further than originally planned in the consultation. In so doing, it is taking into account the favourable situation and responding to the feedback from the consultation. The cantons broadly welcome these steps and a majority also agree with the changes to the original proposals. Public events: up to 100 people indoors and 300 people outdoors For events with spectators or audiences, there will be a limit of 100 instead of 50 people indoors, and 300 instead of 100 people outdoors. Half of the capacity of venues may now be used instead of only a third as before. The same applies to religious events. In contrast to the proposal in the consultation, seats at public events do not have to be allocated; the wearing of masks and social distancing are sufficient. At non-spectator and non-audience events such as club meetings or guided tours, the maximum number of people will be increased to 50 instead of 15 indoors and out. This also applies to private events such as weddings or birthday parties not held at private venues. In the consultation, the Federal Council had proposed a maximum of 30 people. There are no longer any restrictions on gatherings of people in public spaces. Private gatherings: indoors 30 people, outdoors 50 people The Federal Council is increasing the limits for private gatherings from 10 to 30 people indoors, and from 15 to 50 people outdoors. A large majority of the cantons insisted on this step. In the consultation, the Federal Council had not envisaged any changes for private gatherings. Restaurants: indoor service allowed and tables for 6 outdoors As of Monday, restaurants will once again be able to serve guests indoors. The following conditions apply: distancing or screens, no more than four people per table, contact details of all guests to be recorded, seating only.

The rules for public events apply. Matches for team sports may only be held outdoors. Contact sports and activities such as partner dancing and wrestling are only permitted indoors without masks in fixed groups of four people. The space requirement for gentle sporting activities carried out indoors (e.g. yoga) will be reduced from 15 to 10 square metres per person. Cultural activities: larger groups allowed As with sport, the maximum group size for cultural activities will also be increased to 50 people. Amateur cultural performances are now allowed. The rules for public events apply. The space requirement for brass bands will be reduced from 25 to 10 square metres per person. Amateur and professional choir performances will once again be allowed. Higher education, professional education and continuing education institutions: more face-to-face teaching possible No requirement to work from home for businesses that conduct regular tests Working from home will be a recommendation rather than a requirement for businesses that carry out weekly testing. A return to the office should be gradual so as not to jeopardise the vaccination process of staff. Since 18 January, employers have been required to instruct staff to work from home depending on the type of activity and where practicable. Once everyone who so wishes has been vaccinated (start of normalisation phase), the rules on working from home will be eased without further restrictions. The rules to protect people at high risk in the workplace will remain in place. No quarantine for those already vaccinated or recovered from COVID People who have recovered from COVID are exempt from contact and travel quarantine for a period of six months. Given that people who have been vaccinated cannot transmit the virus to a relevant extent, they too are now exempt from contact and travel quarantine for a period of six months, as well as from the requirement to be tested and provide contact details on arrival in Switzerland, as long as they have been fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved in Switzerland or by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). People under the age of 16 are also exempt from travel quarantine and the requirement to be tested on arrival in Switzerland. The exemptions from travel quarantine and the requirement to be tested do not apply to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID arriving from countries with virus variants of significant concern.

In the consultation, the proposed date was 1 September. There will be no capacity restrictions for indoor events. There will be no spectator limit at outdoor events with compulsory seating. The third step is closely linked to the entry into the stabilisation phase, when all persons wishing to be vaccinated have been. ‘Protective shield’: deductible and excess reduced In order to support the staging of events of supra-cantonal significance, in its spring session Parliament introduced a ‘protective shield’ for the events industry in Art. 11a of the COVID-19 Act. This allows public events to be planned even before it is clear whether or not the epidemiological situation allows them to go ahead. The federal government and the cantons contribute to the unmet costs of events that have to be cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. In order to benefit from this compensation, the public event concerned must have been approved by the canton and covered by the ‘protective shield’. Furthermore, the event must be expected to attract visitors from outside the canton in which it is to take place and be attended by at least 1,000 people a day. The organiser bears a deductible of CHF 5,000 per event for the uncovered costs and an excess of 10 per cent of the remaining amount. The Federal Council reduced the amount of the deductible and excess following the consultation. If the cantons bear half of the uncovered costs, the Confederation will cover the other half. The Confederation and the cantons contribute a maximum of CHF 5 million per event. This applies to events between 1 June 2021 and 30 April 2022. A legal basis for implementation has yet to be put in place in most cantons. Trade and public fairs Capacity restrictions on large-scale trade and public fairs are to be aligned with those applicable to shopping centres. In order for trade and public fairs to be able to benefit from the ‘protective shield’, such events must now be approved by the relevant cantonal authorities."
Coronavirus: Federal Council launches consultation on fifth round of reopening steps,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-83951.html,2021-06-11,"Bern, 11.06.2021 - From Monday, 28 June, the Federal Council is planning a further range of reopening measures, including lifting the requirement to wear a mask outdoors, increasing group sizes per table at restaurants, and reopening clubs and discos for people with a COVID certificate. Shops, leisure and sports facilities should be able to make greater use of their available capacity. In addition, rules for events should be simplified and harmonised. The Federal Council submitted these and further proposals for consultation following its meeting on 11 June. A final decision will be taken on 23 June. Case numbers, hospital admissions and the occupancy of intensive care units with COVID patients are all falling significantly. In view of these positive developments and the progress being made with the rollout of vaccinations, the Federal Council is planning to lift further restrictions before the summer holidays. It will take a final decision on 23 June when the impact of the fourth round of opening steps is clear.  As set out in the three-phase plan, the COVID certificate should enter into use. For large-scale events and at clubs and discos it will be a requirement. Events for fewer than 1000 people, sports, cultural and leisure facilities and restaurants may limit access to people with a COVID certificate to benefit from less stringent protective measures. The certificate may not be used in everyday life situations, such as on public transport, in shops and at private events. Requirement to wear a mask outdoors to be lifted The requirement to wear a mask in outdoor areas of publicly accessible venues, leisure facilities, railway stations and bus stops should be lifted, including on the decks of ships and on chairlifts. The general requirement to wear a mask at work should also be lifted. Employers still have a duty to ensure that staff are protected, but are free to decide where and when masks should be worn. Masks must still be worn if staff are unable to maintain the necessary distance from customers or guests, such as in shops and restaurants.    With regard to the education sector, the Federal Council will lift the national requirement for masks to be worn at upper secondary level. The cantons should once again assume responsibility for setting rules covering baccalaureate, specialised and vocational schools. Better use of available capacity Shops, leisure and sporting facilities should be able to make better use of their available capacity. The rules will be harmonised: if masks are worn indoors, the basis for calculating capacity should be reduced to 4 square metres per person. At facilities where it is not possible to wear a mask, such as at indoor pools, the basis will be 10 square metres per person. Water parks should be allowed to open for all visitors on this basis. Restaurants: Group size unlimited outdoors Restaurants should be allowed to seat up to six people at tables indoors instead of four. The seating requirement remains. The limit on group sizes and seating requirement outdoors should be lifted. Masks must be worn when moving around the premises indoors. The requirement to record the contact details of all guests remains. Clubs and discos to reopen Clubs and discos should be allowed to reopen if access is limited to people with a valid COVID certificate. No more than 250 people may be present at any one time. Masks do not have to be worn but guest contact details must be recorded. Events with a certificate: Simplified and harmonised rules At the end of May, the Federal Council decided that large-scale events would be allowed with a COVID certificate. It is now proposing a number of changes. The rules on wearing masks should be simplified: people should only have to wear a mask when moving around. In addition, the maximum number of people allowed should be harmonised: up to 3000 people indoors, and up to 5000 people outdoors, regardless of whether a seating requirement applies. Up to two-thirds of the venue’s capacity may be used. Events without a certificate: 1000 people seated, 250 people standing The following should apply for events without a COVID certificate: if the public are seated, as in the cinema, at the theatre or at a football match, up to 1000 people may attend. If people are moving around, as at a wedding or a concert with no seating, up to 250 people may attend. Half of the venue’s capacity may be used. These limits apply indoors and outdoors. Indoors masks must be worn and the necessary distance maintained. Outdoors masks must be worn when moving around. Events involving dancing are not allowed. Rules regarding the consumption of food and drink may vary depending on the specific situation. In general, what is allowed in a private setting should also apply to events at publicly accessible venues. In other words, at gatherings of family and friends with up to 30 people indoors or 50 outdoors, there is no need for protective measures. So when celebrating a birthday at a restaurant, for example, requirements to wear masks, keep a distance or remain seated do not have to be applied.  Amateur sports and cultural activities: Indoor capacity increased For sporting activities, group size limits, currently 50 people outdoors and 4 people indoors, will be lifted. Indoors the requirement to wear a mask and maintain the necessary distance will remain. If it is not possible to maintain a safe distance, such as during team sports, or if masks cannot be worn due to exertion, such as during endurance sports or when practising wind instruments, a capacity restriction of 10 square metres per person should apply. Choirs should once again be allowed to give performances indoors. Self-tests also available at drugstores and in shops Approved self-tests may also be sold at drugstores and in shops. The packs of five self-tests per person per month funded by the Confederation should continue to be available in pharmacies only but only for people who have not been vaccinated or who have not had COVID. Decision on the duration of vaccine effectiveness According to a number of studies, vaccinations with the vaccines approved for use in Switzerland are likely to remain effective for longer than six months. The Federal Council will decide on 23 June on extending the duration of effectiveness based on an assessment by the Federal Commission for Vaccination. This would have an impact on a number of regulations including those concerning the COVID certificate.

"Coronavirus: Federal Council to take further, wide-ranging reopening step and to relax rules on entering Switzerland",https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-84127.html,2021-06-23,"Bern, 23.06.2021 - The measures in place to contain the coronavirus will be eased and simplified significantly from Saturday, 26 June. The requirements to work from home and to wear masks outdoors, for example, will be lifted. Furthermore, restaurants will again be allowed to seat as many people together as they wish, and large-scale events with COVID certificates will be allowed to take place without restrictions on capacity or the number of people present. This reopening step therefore goes further than proposed in the consultation. At its meeting on 23 June, the Federal Council also decided to relax rules on entering the country. The health-related measures at the border will now focus on those arriving from countries with variants of the virus that give rise to concern. The reopening steps introduced on 19 April and 31 May have not had a negative impact on the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Case numbers and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 are continuing to fall sharply. In addition, around half of the adult population will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. However, caution is still warranted. Switzerland has been in a stabilisation phase since the beginning of June. Not all those who wish to be vaccinated have received their jabs yet. The Federal Council is continuing to monitor the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant closely.  In view of these positive developments in the epidemiological situation, the progress being made with the rollout of the vaccines and the responses to the consultation received from the cantons, social partners and other participants, the Federal Council has decided to take a reopening step that is more wide ranging than proposed in the consultation. Rules will be harmonised and simplified, and the COVID-19 Special Situation Ordinance will be broadly revised. Reopening step more wide ranging than planned The fifth reopening step extends beyond the proposals in the consultation paper in the following main areas: -              Requirement to work from home downgraded to a recommendation -              No limit on the number of people per table at restaurants -              No restrictions on capacity or the number of people and no requirement to wear masks at large-scale events with a COVID certificate requirement -              No requirement to wear masks or keep a distance during cultural and sporting activities, and no distinction between professionals and amateurs -              No restrictions on face-to-face teaching at higher education and continuing education institutions Requirement to wear masks outdoors lifted The requirement to wear masks in outdoor areas of publicly accessible venues, leisure facilities and restaurant terraces will be lifted. On public transport, outdoor spaces are defined as any areas with large openings on at least two sides, such as railway platforms (including those underground), bus stops, underpasses and overpasses, or halls and shopping arcades. Indoor spaces are enclosed underground station complexes (such as the underground area at Zurich main station) including the underground access and shopping areas in basements and indoor waiting rooms. The recommendations issued by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) remain in place: masks should be worn where it is not possible to maintain a distance of 1.5m. Masks must still be worn indoors as it is not possible to check whether or not someone has been vaccinated or has recovered from COVID-19. Requirement to wear masks at work and in upper secondary level schools lifted   The general requirement to wear masks in the workplace will also be lifted. Employers still have a duty to ensure that staff are protected, but are free to decide where and when masks should be worn. The government is also lifting the requirement for masks to be worn in schools at upper secondary level. The cantons will again assume responsibility for setting rules covering baccalaureate, specialised and vocational schools. Requirement to work from home downgraded to a recommendation The requirement to work from home will now become a recommendation, and the requirement to conduct regular workplace testing is to be lifted.  No restrictions on face-to-face teaching  Restrictions on class sizes for face-to-face teaching at professional education, continuing education and higher education institutions will be lifted, and there will be no requirement to conduct regular testing. Full use can be made of available capacity Shops, leisure and sporting facilities will be able to make full use of their available capacity. Water parks may also reopen. However, a restriction of two-thirds’ capacity will apply to events and venues where no COVID certificate is required. Restaurants: no limit on group size per table The limit on the number of people allowed to sit at a table at restaurants will be lifted. Guests must still remain seated indoors and the distance between guest groups must still be respected. Contact details must still be recorded, but only for one person per group. Masks must still be worn, apart from when seated. The limit on the size of guest groups outdoors is to be lifted and guests will no longer have to be seated. The distance between guest groups must still be respected. Contact details no longer need to be recorded for guests outdoors. Clubs and discos allowed to reopen Clubs and discos will be allowed to reopen provided access is limited to people with a valid COVID certificate. The proposals set out in the consultation paper to limit attendance to 250 people and require the recording of contact details have been dropped. As at all venues where COVID certificates are required, there will be no requirement to wear masks.Events with a certificate: no masks, no restrictions  There will be no restrictions on events at which access is limited to people with a COVID certificate, including large-scale events. Events for over 10,000 people may go ahead from 26 June and the venue’s full capacity may be used. The protection plan must however set out how access is to be limited to people with a COVID certificate. Cantonal authorisation is required for events for over 1000 people.  Events without a COVID certificate requirementThe rule for events without a COVID certificate requirement are as follows:  -              If the public are seated, up to 1000 people may attend – indoors or outdoors. -              If people are standing or moving around, up to 250 people may attend indoors, and up to 500 outdoors.  -              Up to two-thirds of the venue’s capacity may be used – indoors or outdoors.  -              Indoors: masks must be worn in areas where food and drink are served, and food and drink may only be consumed in the designated areas; contact details must be recorded if seated. -              Outdoors: no requirement to wear masks.  -              Events and concerts involving dancing are not allowed.  Private events: 30 people indoors, 50 outdoors The limits regarding private events continue to apply, i.e. no more than 30 people indoors and 50 people outdoors.Trade fairs: no capacity restrictions  The ban on trade fairs for fewer than 1000 people indoors is to be lifted. Capacity restrictions for trade fairs will also be lifted regardless of the number of visitors or the restriction to people with a COVID certificate. At trade fairs without a COVID certificate requirement, masks must be worn indoors and food and drink may only be consumed in the designated areas. Sporting and cultural activities: no masks required There are to be no restrictions for people carrying out sporting or cultural activities outdoors. However, contact details must be recorded for indoor activities. Requirements to wear masks and keep a distance will be lifted, as will capacity restrictions.  Duration of vaccine effectiveness to be extended to 12 months The Federal Council is extending the duration of vaccine effectiveness for mRNA vaccines approved for use in Switzerland for those fully vaccinated to 12 months. The decision is based on the recommendation made by the Federal Commission for Vaccination. People who have been vaccinated are therefore now exempt from contact and travel quarantine for a period of 12 months. In line with the requirements for the EU Digital COVID Certificate, people who have recovered from COVID-19 are exempt from quarantine for a period of 6 months. The validity of rapid antigen tests is also being extended from 24 to 48 hours. Self-tests also available at drugstores and in shops Approved self-tests may now also be sold at drugstores and in shops. The packs of five self-tests per person per month funded by the Confederation will continue to be available in pharmacies, but only for people who have not been vaccinated or who have not had COVID-19. Provision will be made in the COVID-19 Ordinance 3 for the reimbursement of the cost of tests taken prior to camps and on access to events. Restrictions on entering Switzerland to be relaxed The Federal Council has also decided to relax the requirements for entering Switzerland, as it proposed in the consultation. Persons entering from the Schengen area will no longer be required to quarantine. The requirement to be tested will now apply only to persons arriving by plane who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from COVID-19. Contact details will still be required when arriving by plane. In addition, Switzerland is easing the existing entry restrictions for persons arriving from third countries who can prove they have been vaccinated. The list of countries issued by the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) has been amended accordingly. It is now once again possible for third-country citizens travelling from countries such as the USA, Albania or Serbia to enter Switzerland. Entry from a country with a variant of the virus of concern The current list of high-risk countries issued by the Federal Office of Public Health is to be revised and will only contain countries or regions where virus variants of concern to Switzerland are in circulation. Persons who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease will be permitted to enter Switzerland from these countries or regions without having to be tested or to quarantine as long as it is certain that the vaccination offers good protection. Those who have neither been vaccinated nor have recovered must present a negative PCR test or rapid antigen test and go into quarantine on entry.  In practice, this means that persons who have been vaccinated or who have recovered do not have to produce a negative test even when travelling from countries where the Delta variant is widespread (such as India or the United Kingdom) and do not have to quarantine on entry. The vaccines used in Switzerland are only slightly less effective against the Delta variant and thus still offer a very high level of protection. International compatibility of Swiss COVID certificate As a Schengen extension, the Federal Council also took steps today to adopt two EU regulations on the EU Digital COVID Certificate. The process to have the Swiss certificate recognised by the EU has been launched. During the six-week transition phase commencing 1 July, it is likely that other forms of proof will also be accepted in the EU/EFTA area. It is therefore important to check the specific entry requirements prior to travel. The reopening steps introduced on 19 April and 31 May have not had a negative impact on the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Case numbers and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 are continuing to fall sharply. In addition, around half of the adult population will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month.

Coronavirus: Switzerland passes four million doses of vaccine on to COVAX,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-84254.html,2021-06-30,"Bern, 30.06.2021 - At its meeting on 30 June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council decided to transfer to the COVAX Facility a large part of the 5.4 million or so doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that have been ordered. Switzerland is thus able to make a substantial contribution to global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. COVAX is an initiative to ensure equal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines across the world. Given the very uneven global distribution of vaccine doses, the pandemic is expected to continue for some considerable time across the world. Switzerland’s vaccination campaign continues to progress: so far around 60 per cent of the adult population has been vaccinated once, and over 40 per cent are fully vaccinated. There is also enough vaccine available for children and adolescents to also be vaccinated and to cover any booster vaccinations. The federal government has ordered additional vaccine for 2022; this will also take account of possible variants of the virus.  The federal government is focusing in particular on mRNA vaccines. These are proving to be highly effective and well tolerated. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are based on this technology. However, other vaccines are also to be used, especially for people who have an intolerance to mRNA vaccines.Since sufficient vaccine is available to protect the population, the Federal Council has decided to hand on four million of a total of around 5.4 million doses of AstraZeneca to the COVAX Facility. This leaves 1.4 million doses of the vector-based vaccine reserved for probable use in Switzerland. They are to be used primarily for people who have an intolerance to mRNA vaccines or have received their first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine abroad, and for those who want an alternative to an mRNA vaccine. The vaccine will be available as soon as Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, has authorised it and the FOPH and the Federal Vaccination Commission (EKIF/CFV) has passed the vaccination recommendation on the basis of Swissmedic’s authorisation. International engagement to manage the pandemicThis year the COVAX Facility plans to make up to two billion doses of vaccine available to the participating countries. Already in February 2021 COVAX distributed the first doses to countries with low and medium incomes. To date a total of more than 88 million doses of vaccine have been delivered to around 131 participating countries.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Switzerland has been working for a global solution for the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Last year Switzerland provided CHF 20 million in support for the 92 lower-income countries. In addition to this, in April 2021 the Federal Council decided to support access to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) with a further CHF 300 million, 125 million of which will flow into the COVAX Facility. The aim of the ACT-A is to facilitate access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and tests and strengthen the healthcare system in the fight against the pandemic.The COVAX Facility was initiated by the WHO and other organisations in April 2020, and is operated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) and the WHO. As co-chair of the Friends of the COVAX Facility, Switzerland has played an active role in setting it up. Switzerland’s vaccination campaign continues to progress: so far around 60 per cent of the adult population has been vaccinated once, and over 40 per cent are fully vaccinated. There is also enough vaccine available for children and adolescents to also be vaccinated and to cover any booster vaccinations. The federal government has ordered additional vaccine for 2022; this will also take account of possible variants of the virus. The federal government is focusing in particular on mRNA vaccines. These are proving to be highly effective and well tolerated. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are based on this technology. However, other vaccines are also to be used, especially for people who have an intolerance to mRNA vaccines. Since sufficient vaccine is available to protect the population, the Federal Council has decided to hand on four million of a total of around 5.4 million doses of AstraZeneca to the COVAX Facility. This leaves 1.4 million doses of the vector-based vaccine reserved for probable use in Switzerland. They are to be used primarily for people who have an intolerance to mRNA vaccines or have received their first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine abroad, and for those who want an alternative to an mRNA vaccine. The vaccine will be available as soon as Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, has authorised it and the FOPH and the Federal Vaccination Commission (EKIF/CFV) has passed the vaccination recommendation on the basis of Swissmedic’s authorisation. This year the COVAX Facility plans to make up to two billion doses of vaccine available to the participating countries. Already in February 2021 COVAX distributed the first doses to countries with low and medium incomes. To date a total of more than 88 million doses of vaccine have been delivered to around 131 participating countries.

Coronavirus: Federal Council sets out plans for the coming months,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-84274.html,2021-06-30,"Bern, 30.06.2021 - At its meeting on 30 June, the Federal Council discussed ways of preparing Switzerland for the autumn and winter months and a possible renewed rise in the number of coronavirus cases. It has produced a report setting out various scenarios and its considerations on how to proceed. The focus is on the rapid identification of new variants of concern, continuing the vaccination campaign, ensuring sufficient capacity for testing and contact tracing in the cantons. The epidemiological situation in Switzerland has improved significantly in recent months. The Federal Council envisages three possible scenarios as to how the epidemic could develop in the coming months. All three scenarios are based on the assumption that the virus will be endemic in the long term, in other words that the virus will not disappear but continue to circulate among the population. Most people will come into contact and become infected with the virus at some point if they are not protected from it through vaccination.  Three scenarios for autumn and winter Under scenario 1, case numbers remain at a low level. Smaller outbreaks are still possible. Case numbers may rise slightly due to seasonal factors, but do not lead to a significant burden on the healthcare system. The measures still in place can be lifted. The crisis would be over. Under scenario 2, case numbers rise in the autumn or winter at the latest. This may be due to a number of factors, for example the proportion of people who have not been vaccinated, the lifting of measures, seasonal effects or the appearance of new, more infectious virus variants. This increase places such a heavy burden on the healthcare system that certain basic government measures need to remain in place or be reintroduced, such as the requirement to wear masks or social distancing. Booster vaccinations may become necessary. Under scenario 3, one or more new virus variants emerge against which vaccination or prior infection no longer provide protection, or offer significantly less protection. There is a new wave of the pandemic. Strong government intervention and renewed vaccination are required. Medium-term planning efforts on the part of the federal government and the cantons are focusing on scenario 2 and the following challenges:  Rapidly identifying new virus variants of concern  The sooner new virus variants of concern can be identified, the quicker the introduction and spread can be limited through targeted measures. The Federal Council has already decided on precautionary measures, such as border procedures. Today it instructed the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA), in collaboration with the relevant federal agencies and the cantons, to strengthen the surveillance system for detecting new virus variants and monitoring their spread in Switzerland. Increasing willingness to get vaccinated Widespread vaccination of the population is crucial to relieve the burden on the healthcare system and to manage the epidemic. A possible increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the autumn will largely depend on the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated. The vaccination campaign will therefore be intensively pursued. Medium-term planning will involve preparing for booster vaccinations and adapting vaccines to new virus variants. Preparing for booster vaccinations  Vaccines are currently considered to provide protection against mild forms of COVID-19 for at least 12 months and protect against severe cases and hospitalisations for over 12 months, and this can be considerably longer in healthy adults. How long the vaccination protects against transmission is not yet known. In order to ensure sufficient protection in the longer term, booster vaccinations for certain population groups or those already vaccinated will probably be necessary from next winter at the earliest. The Federal Council has instructed the FDHA, with the involvement of the federal and cantonal authorities concerned, to initiate timely preparations for the planning and implementation of booster vaccinations. The cantons remain responsible for organising vaccinations and ensuring the necessary capacity. The DDPS has the task of ensuring the distribution of the vaccine until this can be transferred to established private distribution channels. The vaccines approved in Switzerland have proven to be very effective against the virus variants that have appeared so far. However, it cannot be ruled out that the appearance of new virus variants will make it necessary to adapt the vaccines. The technology behind mRNA vaccines means that they can be adapted relatively simply and quickly to new virus variants. In the best case, it is likely to take around six months before vaccinations can be carried out with an adapted vaccine. Adapting the testing strategy Access to testing will continue to be low-threshold and open to all. Those who experience symptoms will still be able to get tested immediately. It must be possible to quickly increase laboratory capacity should the epidemic situation deteriorate. The testing strategy will be adapted once all adults who want to be vaccinated have received their jabs. Preventive testing is to be scaled back at the start of the normalisation phase, with the exception of schools. The federal government calls on the cantons to use repetitive testing to ensure that schools can continue to operate without restrictive measures. Steps are to be taken to prevent outbreaks involving children as far as possible. In countries where the delta variant is prevalent, there is an above-average number of infections in schools. It is not yet clear when vaccinations for children under 12 will be possible. No study data are available for this age group yet. Swissmedic has so far approved one vaccine for children and adolescents aged 12 and over. Maintaining capacity for contact tracing Even in the event of a further steps towards normalisation, contact tracing remains an important measure in quickly isolating cases that occur and preventing them from spreading. This is particularly important if virus variants of concern emerge, or if there are cases among particularly vulnerable people, for example in old people's and nursing homes. It is therefore important that the cantons maintain or are able to rapidly ramp up the necessary capacities for tracking infections. Maintaining capacity in the healthcare system In the event of a renewed increase in the number of cases, sufficient capacity must be available, especially in hospitals. This is the responsibility of the cantons. In addition, the healthcare system must be able to cope with the additional burden created by long-term effects of coronavirus (long COVID). The impact of the epidemic and the measures taken on mental health must also continue to be monitored. End of the special situation The Federal Council also addressed the question of when to declare an end to the special situation under the Epidemics Act. This can end when no emergency health situation exists worldwide because of SARS-CoV-2, and when the virus no longer poses a threat to public health in Switzerland.  Further aspects of medium-term planning In its outline for the coming months, the Federal Council also discussed other topics, such as the supply of medical goods, the longer-term impact on society of the pandemic, international aspects, entry regulations, crisis organisation and digital systems. Most of these topics concern the federal government and the cantons. Extension of SwissCovid app The Federal Council also decided today to add a check-in function to the SwissCovid app from the beginning of July, to improve contact tracing. The decentralised system does not record any personal data and uses neither Bluetooth nor GPS. The check-in function is to be used for smaller events – for example private meetings, sports training sessions, choir rehearsals and small concerts or business meetings. Event organisers can create a QR code directly in the app, which guests scan when they arrive to check in to the event. After the event, guests confirm in the app that they have left the event. This information is stored locally on their own mobile phone for 14 days and is then deleted automatically. If a person tests positive for coronavirus after an event and enters the Covidcode into the SwissCovid app, an automatic notification is sent to all those who attended and checked in at the same event during the same period. Funding scheme for medicines against COVID-19 The Federal Council has also decided to transfer implementation of its programme to promote the development of medicines to treat COVID-19 to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and Innosuisse. The FOPH will decide on the granting of funding. Innosuisse will handle calls for proposals and the technical evaluation of the submitted projects. The programme is intended to promote research, development and production of medicines against COVID-19 for safe and rapid distribution to the Swiss population. The programme criteria and the submission procedure are to be published before the end of July. The programme runs until the end of 2022. The epidemiological situation in Switzerland has improved significantly in recent months.

Coronavirus: Federal Council decides to maintain protective measures and calls on the public to get vaccinated,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-84676.html,2021-08-11,"Bern, 11.08.2021 - At its meeting on 11 August, the Federal Council decided to maintain the measures that are still in place. However, this is designed to safeguard hospital capacity rather than protect the unvaccinated. A return to normality requires a massive increase in the number of people getting vaccinated. The current testing strategy, which is considered a key element of the response to the pandemic, is to be continued. From 1 October, tests for people without symptoms will no longer be free of charge. The Federal Council is launching a consultation on these proposals and will announce its decision on 25 August. Almost half of the population in Switzerland is now fully vaccinated. However, the pace of first vaccinations has stagnated since 11 July even though the cantons now have sufficient vaccine supplies. The Federal Council considers that all those who wish to be vaccinated have had the opportunity to do so. In line with its three-phase model (protection, stabilisation, normalisation), it has decided to proceed to the normalisation phase, which was scheduled to begin once all those who wished to be vaccinated had done so.Given the uncertain evolution of the epidemiological situation (rising case numbers, holiday returns, Delta variant) and the fact that a saturation of hospital facilities cannot be ruled out, the Federal Council has decided to retain the limited, generally accepted measures still in place (e.g. masks indoors and on public transport, COVID certificates for large-scale events and nightclubs). It will reassess the situation and possibly adjust the measures at its meeting on 1 September, when the impact of the return from the summer holidays will be more apparent.The priority for the Federal Council is now to safeguard hospital capacity rather than protect the unvaccinated. It will only introduce new measures if the country faces a risk to hospital capacity. In this phase of fighting the pandemic[fro1] , unlike the preceding two phases, a package of strict measures is no longer deemed appropriate as this would unduly restrict the social and economic activities of those who have been vaccinated or have recovered. This also means that any new measures would most likely have a slower and less marked effect in relieving hospital capacity. The Federal Council reminds the cantons of their obligation under the Epidemics Act to take action in the event of a regional increase in infections or any overburdening of their hospital facilities.Call to assume personal responsibilityFor the Federal Council this new phase is about reinforcing personal responsibility. Given that everyone living in Switzerland will at some point come into contact with COVID-19, the Federal Council believes that an increase in infections, hospitalisations and deaths is inevitable. Vaccination remains the most effective way for the population to protect themselves against COVID-19 infection and serious complications. The Federal Council therefore encourages anyone who has not yet been vaccinated to do so without delay. The cantons must therefore ensure that the population continues to have easy access to the vaccine. The Confederation will launch a new information campaign on 16 August.Testing strategy to be adaptedTesting remains a critical measure to keep the pandemic under control, interrupt transmission chains and prevent an overload of hospital capacity. It allows for early detection of infections so that measures can be taken in a local, targeted manner rather than imposing more widescale restrictions.The federal government's current testing strategy is based on routine testing in schools and companies as well as preventative testing. Since spring 2021, the cost of all such tests has been covered by the Confederation. Regular testing in schools, companies and healthcare facilities will continue to be financed by the Confederation. The Federal Council calls on the cantons to organise regular testing in schools as a means of protecting younger children. It also calls on the cantons to make regular testing of unvaccinated staff in care homes and nursing homes mandatory in order to protect those who are particularly vulnerable. However, the federal government is proposing to cease covering the cost of tests for people without symptoms (convenience tests) and of the five self-tests per month for people who have not been vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19, with the exception of children up to the age of 12 and people who are unable to be vaccinated. People who are not vaccinated or who have not recovered from COVID-19 wishing to attend an event where a COVID certificate is required will from 1 October have to pay for the test themselves or get vaccinated in the meantime.The Federal Council is also proposing that people without symptoms will now be able to participate individually in pooled saliva-based PCR tests at their own cost, for example in pharmacies, and in that way obtain a more reliable diagnosis, yet less expensive test. If the test is negative, the person will be issued with a COVID certificate. The Federal Council will consult the cantons and parliamentary committees on these proposed changes and announce its decision on 25 August.Extension of higher vaccination fee for medical practicesThe increase in the standard fee payable to medical practices for each vaccination, which was temporarily set at CHF 24.50 until 30 June, has been extended until 30 September 2021. At its meeting, the Federal Council approved the adjustment of the agreement negotiated by the tariff partners for payment of the COVID-19 vaccination.

Coronavirus: vaccination for Swiss citizens living abroad and cross-border commuters,https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-84754.html,2021-08-18,"Bern, 18.08.2021 - Swiss citizens living abroad, their immediate family members and cross-border commuters without compulsory health insurance are to be allowed to get vaccinated in Switzerland. At its meeting on 18 August, the Federal Council launched consultation proceedings on an amendment to the Epidemics Ordinance. To date, due to the limited availability of vaccine doses, only people resident in Switzerland, cross-border commuters working in the health sector and foreign nationals with compulsory health insurance have been able to get vaccinated in Switzerland. However, now that all people living in Switzerland who wish to be vaccinated have had the opportunity to do so, the Federal Council believes that the vaccine should be made available to other people with close ties to Switzerland. This concerns Swiss citizens living abroad who do not have compulsory health insurance in Switzerland, their immediate family members (partners, children, parents and parents-in-law living in the same household), and cross-border commuters who do not have compulsory health insurance in Switzerland. The Federal Council is consulting the cantons and the social partners on an amendment to the Epidemics Ordinance. This provides for the Confederation to assume the costs of vaccination for cross-border commuters, since they are regularly in Switzerland and could influence the course of the pandemic here. The Federal Council also intends to allow Swiss citizens without compulsory health insurance in Switzerland living abroad and their immediate family members to be vaccinated in Switzerland. For these individuals, who are not normally resident in Switzerland, it is proposing two variants for consultation. Under the first variant, the costs of vaccination are assumed by the Confederation. The second variant requires these individuals to assume the costs of vaccination themselves. The Federal Council will announce its decision on 25 August.
